### Status of Euenthe/Emn1ty

6' tall woman +5", d-cup +1 cup 

Will growth once a day. [1d3, half cup size per + 1d6 [inches gained]]



### Status of the Island, Original

You have a general idea of the region's terrain. It is one of the places where the Nile hits the sea, and the water in the region is generally brackish to full sea water. The target is safely located on an island but that island is poorly suited to growing food due to the limited fresh water supplies from small streams created by regular rainfalls. The city ruins itself have little value be

 sides rubble, although there is housing for the local warlord's troops and slaves. His slaves spend most of their time farming what little practical land was available on the island for the practice. That and logging the local forest or quarry to start rebuilding the city. The continent itself is crawling with monsters but the Isle rarely suffers more than viking-style raids from the more intelligent monsters [e.g. Goblins]



He has a few hundred Masadan slaves, a company or two of soliders, and decent skill at arms. Trade is pretty limited with the Nubian, the city is in shambles and he never properly rebuilt the ports. His resources are limited and he spends most of them defending the city against the roaming bands of brigands, monsters, etc trying to loot his farms.

[BlackRobeRising] (There are a couple obvious bays on the estern and north eastern ends of the island, so those would be easiest)

###Diplomatic Notes

 * Athenians and Spartans are skirmishing through proxy states. War seems to be brewing.


### NPCs Met:

Ex-Slave is named Evel. Has the paper for the thing.


### SESSION LOG:

[BlackRobeRising] Sorry about tht :/

[Emn1ty] np

[Pocketknife] glad to see you are not dead in a ditch.

 it was a bad possibility.

[HausParty] oh hey

[BlackRobeRising] Things just took longer than was planned :(

[Kirveis] I have heard that these things happen.

--- HausParty is now known as Fabius

 Fabius is now known as Fabius_

[Fabius_] so many registered nicks here

[Emn1ty] well, got to do a gotomeeting so I will be split between things

[BlackRobeRising] Apologies for being late.

 Anyway, would you guys like to start in a  couple minutes?

[Pocketknife] yes.

 I just need a drink and I am good to go.

[BlackRobeRising] Alright, I'm still missing Quizzy's sheet.

 So I asked about it.

 Does anyone have any questions before we start?

[Emn1ty] did you see the question about Pocket and I possibly having a linked background?

 also, pali version of character http://www.myth-weavers.com/sheetview.php?sheetid=594756

[dice-bot] [ Euenthe (Paladin Version) :: (Read-Only) - Myth-Weavers ] - http://www.myth-weavers.com

[QuizzyQuin] Oh, here.

[dice-bot] [ Un-named Half-elf Bard :: (Read-Only) - Myth-Weavers ] - http://www.myth-weavers.com

[Kirveis] Um, I have a question. Pyramids? Other wonders of the world?

[BlackRobeRising] I'm fine with a linkend background

--- Emn1ty is now known as Euenthe

[BlackRobeRising] Honestly, I was on some meds that just knocked me out.

 Are you switching to the pally character, Ems?

[Euenthe] I guess so, although I'm still unsure lol

[BlackRobeRising] Spaaace is going to be a bit longer to show up, so I was going to go with the Envoys/RP-oriented session first if that works for everyone?

[Kirveis] It's what I was expecting, so yes.

[QuizzyQuin] I'm fine with that.

[Euenthe] k

[Pocketknife] kk

[BlackRobeRising] Alright. Where would your players meet or should I just pick a location?

[QuizzyQuin] You can just pick a location.

[Pocketknife] pick I guess. A public house we all frequent?

[Kirveis] Old cliche is best cliche?

[Pocketknife] why reinvent the wheel?

[Euenthe] lol

[Kirveis] Because spherical wheels are awesome?

[BlackRobeRising] The first digintary to arrive was a bearded man in a flowing beige robe was the first to arrive. He was old, perhaps in his sixties, and was easily recognized as one of the City Fathers.

 The meeting had been held at his leisure in the lavish house they had provided for the group in prepration for their journey. A single marble dais with chairs for each of the party's members plus two that were empty. One, for a companion who had drunk a bit too much late last night and would hopefully arrive before all of the matters were settled. The other, presumably, was for the City Father when he had said his piece.

 The old man approached to within about thirty feet of the dais before he spoke, "Gentlemen, shall we get down to the buisness of the Charter and what is expected of you in return for it? Just so we can be sure there are no....misunderstandingings....in the future."

[Pocketknife] sense motive

[BlackRobeRising] ((Feel free to roll, Pocket its. .roll 1d20+modifier))

[Pocketknife] kk, I didn't test the command syntax

[QuizzyQuin] I can do it, who has the higher sense motive?

[Pocketknife] .roll 1d20+15

[dice-bot] Pocketknife : 1d20+15 = 29 | [14] | 14+15 | 

[QuizzyQuin] nvm

[BlackRobeRising] ((If you want to roll as well, you can. I have no objectives to multiple people doing so.)

[Pocketknife] more the merrier

[QuizzyQuin] It's fine, you got a 29 anyways.

[Euenthe] well

 you don't know that IC

 :P

[BlackRobeRising] (Well, I tab the person with the answer. He may not share.)

[Euenthe] .roll 1d20+4

[dice-bot] Euenthe : 1d20+4 = 12 | [8] | 8+4 | 

[Euenthe] :\

 not very sensing

* Fabius_ lounges in his marble seat. He brushes black tresses from his face, peering at the old man curiously.

[Kirveis] .roll 1d20+1

[dice-bot] Kirveis : 1d20+1 = 13 | [12] | 12+1 | 

[Fabius_] .roll 1d20+13 Knowledge Local to know stuff about this guy

[Pocketknife] he is being honest my friends.

[dice-bot] Fabius_ : 1d20+13 Knowledge Local to know stuff about this guy = 13 | [11],[] | 11+13 0 Local to know stuff about this guy | 

[Fabius_] (I broke it, but that should be 24 I think)

[BlackRobeRising] (Ya, it doesn't handle that bit well yet. xD)

[Euenthe] (We using parenthesis for ooc stuff?)

* Kirveis slithers over to one of the seats, considers it for a while, and coils around it so as to sit in it, albeit somewhat awkwardly, and folds her hands in front of herself on the table while considering the elderly man.

[BlackRobeRising] (I am)

[Fabius_] (it's what I usually do)

[QuizzyQuin] (I think so)

[Euenthe] (I'll be next to my charge, I guess which will be Pocketknife's character)

[Pocketknife] whats the syntax for self references like Keirveis?

[Kirveis] .roll 1d20+10 Knowledge (Local) to be in on whatever Fabius knows about the old man

[dice-bot] Kirveis : 1d20+10 Knowledge (Local) to be in on whatever Fabius knows about the old man = 0 | [19],[] | 19+10 0 (Local) to be in on whatever Fabius knows about the 0 man | 

[Fabius_] (gonna be in and out of the scene, doing some last-minute web design work)

[Euenthe] (Kirveis, it's /me )

[Pocketknife] knowledge local .roll 1d20+3

 .roll 1d20+3

[dice-bot] Pocketknife : 1d20+3 = 9 | [6] | 6+3 | 

[Pocketknife] lol

[QuizzyQuin] (What is Knowledge Nobility even used for?)

[Fabius_] "What, in particular, needs discussion Alex?"

[Pocketknife] (knowledge nobility is knowledge of the current power structure, ie Lanisters are a Lion on scarlet, always pay their debts, etc)

[QuizzyQuin] (Oh that's good.)

[Pocketknife] (if you wanted to know the noble in the next county, for instance)

 (public knowledge stuff, or rumor based at strech)

[BlackRobeRising] Alex chuckled and replied evenly, "The terms of the agreement honestly, it shouldn't take long. We've granted you a charter to settle the ruins of Masada in our name. In return we expect a reasonable tithe of 10% of all income generated from this project to fund the defense of our beloved city. The Athenians and Spartans have been skirmishing again on land and at sea through proxy disputes amongst their respective allies

 ."

[Pocketknife] Diplomacy check to amend the deal to have 2 years without tithe and 8 at 5%, as to help build the colony to produce greater overall wealth for both our parties.

 .roll 1d20+13

[QuizzyQuin] I'll roll for Diplomacy

 .roll 1d20+15

[Pocketknife] oh noes.

[dice-bot] Pocketknife : 1d20+13 = 16 | [3] | 3+13 | 

 QuizzyQuin : 1d20+15 = 33 | [18] | 18+15 | 

[Euenthe] assist

 (+2 to Pocketknife's roll)

[Fabius_] (I can assist with that, but I'll wait until I see what Quizzy says)

[QuizzyQuin] (You want me to rp that roll?)

[BlackRobeRising] ( Well otherwise Idk wtf you are asking for, so yes )

[QuizzyQuin] (I'm just doing what Pocket wanted)

[Euenthe] (QuizzyQuin you need to say something to make a diplomacy check, just standing there looking diplomatic isn't enough lol)

[QuizzyQuin] Actually Alex, we were wondering if we could change this deal a bit. How about 2 years without the tithe; and after that we could the next 8 at half of the original: 5%.

[Pocketknife] (I am sorry, I don't have a lot of text based exp, we should check w/ group before blindly rolling? :))

[Euenthe] (no, it's fine)

[QuizzyQuin] (Tottaly rp'd that)

[BlackRobeRising] (You an blindly roll and such, you just need to say something IC about what you are doing or I'm just like okay. xD)

[QuizzyQuin] (rp then roll, or roll then rp?)

[BlackRobeRising] (Either direction is fine)

[Pocketknife] Then obviously we would honor the deal at 10% after that, 10% of a bigger pie.

[Fabius_] (Assisting) "We feel that this wouldn't be too much to ask," Fabius adds, smirking slowly. "Considering that we will be providing a home and work for your refugees."

 (I am so down to play a game of Board Rooms & Backstabbers

 )

[Pocketknife] (this is it, in the iron age)

[BlackRobeRising] Alex shrugged at the request, he was impressed by the reasoning although he wasn't sure why. He knew they'd need the funds, it was only a be matter of time before the Athenians and Spartans resort to open warfare. He said evenly, "We can give you a couple of years delay in the tax but we really need the full amount as soon as possible. The Spartans and Athenians are unlikely to stay out of a war for much longer."

* Euenthe just stands around, not really wanting to garner too much attention to herself.

[BlackRobeRising] (More or less. But you'll only get one of these a season, at most.)

--- Spaaaace_Work is now known as Spaaaace

[Kirveis] ACTION listens in silence as she considers the terms being discussed, inclining her head to listen to something whispered to her by the tiny fey-looking girl who appears to serve as her familiar, then inquires, "Councilor Charis, would it be correct that this grants us leave to do as we please with the ruins and whatever we build there? That we shall be entirely independent aside from this... annual contribution to your defensiv

--- Spaaaace is now known as Confernicus

[BlackRobeRising] Charis shrugged at that slightly. His fingers fidgeted with his robe as he looked downwards a bit, perhaps examining Kirveis's breasts more than the content of her words. "Yes and no. The day-to-day administration of your colony would be at your discretion but it would be expected to follow our lead in matters of foreign policy and to honor any agreements we make with the other Corinthian city-states, the Babylonians, an

 d so forth."

[Pocketknife] What about domestic policy?

[Fabius_] (he just said it's our discretion)

[BlackRobeRising] "Domestic policy, in the domains of the colony, would be your concern. As long as you are not seizing citizens of Argos without just cause and are willing to settle for exile as punishment, it is entire at your discretion."

[Pocketknife] (everyone satisfied with this?)

* Fabius_ shrugs. "Good enough."

[QuizzyQuin] Sounds all within reason.

* Confernicus steps in to the room wearing a cloak and hood etched with various pieces of iconography, "I apologize i'm late."

 Kirveis nods and smiles thinly, "That is acceptable, but surely it would not be too unforward to request autonomy with regards to establishing trade?" She turns as our final party member finally arrives, scowling momentarily and then turning back to Alexander.

 Confernicus takes a seat

[BlackRobeRising] Alex's frown deepened at the words autonomy and trade being in the same sentence. "The City Fathers feel trade is a matter of foreign policy and within our domain to make decisions. However, as long as you are not trading with a party engaged in hostilities, overt or covert, against the City-State of Argos I think we can safely say that we will not object to any reasonable trade agreement as long as we get first call on 

 the goods in question."

[Confernicus] "And who well be making the calls on whether or not a trade agreement is acceptable, specifically?"

[BlackRobeRising] "If we've asked for a regular supply of goods before you made the agreement or if the party you are trading with is engaged in hostilities against us or our allies. I think that is a definition that is easy to work with, no?"

* Kirveis produces a journal, quill, and stoppered inkpot from within her robes, and begins writing out the terms as delineated so far, occasionally muttering out loud as she speaks, "Two year exemption from tithe... defer on all foreign policy... right of first refusal on trade goods..."

[Confernicus] "So long as those rules stay consistent, I have no objection"

[BlackRobeRising] Alex shrugged and said, "For the time being, it should be. If the Athenians and the Spartans go to war, as we expect, in the next few years...we feel 'trade' falls under foreign policy and we may need to make adjustments."

[Confernicus] "It would of course be inappropriate for a colony to openly trade with it's empire's enemies."

* Kirveis looks up suddenly, "Ah, but any such adjustments would still not interfere with our domestic policies, yes? You would not, for example, require us to begin producing armaments?"

[BlackRobeRising] "We are hardly an empire, just a city-state with a few colonies. The Athenians or Spartans? Those would be empires."

[Pocketknife] "Perhaps we should leave this talk of trade aside and talk provisioning for the Colony."

[Confernicus] "a state holding foreign colonies is an empire, large or small."

 "I agree"

[BlackRobeRising] He frowned at Kirveis's question, "Kirveis, at war time we reserve the right to make what policy changes and requirements of our colonies as we see fit. We need to be prepared to defend ourselves. So yes, we might requirement armaments, other war material, and even outright demands you provide us with additional troops for campaigns to defend ourselves."

* Euenthe is starting to doze off a bit.

[Euenthe] (:P)

[Pocketknife] "All the more reason to get a fast start in our new homeland."

[BlackRobeRising] (Bored there, Euenthe?)

[Euenthe] (only in character)

 (she's not one for politics)

* Kirveis doesn't look too surprised by Alexander's reply, but quickly begins writing in amendments in her journal, her ears twitching slightly as she listens in silence for now.

[QuizzyQuin] And what if we can't meet the required amounts of armaments, troops, or other war materials?

[Pocketknife] "what will the motherland provide to ensure healthy colonies to aid her in her eventual hour of need?"

[BlackRobeRising] Alex chuckled, "Then we'll take the tax in specie, if need be, to make up the difference. The Atlantians and the Babylonians would always be willing to sell us mercenaries and arms but the prices would be higher. As for our assurances? It is a high risk operation that you signed up for. We've already given you a good, sturdy boat and a crew for it. If a major power attacks you, we'll attempt to intervene or mediate depen

 ding on the situation."

[Euenthe] .roll 1d20+4 will save to stay awake

[dice-bot] Euenthe : 1d20+4 will save to stay awake = 15 | [11] | 11+4 will save to stay awake | 

[Euenthe] I think I manage

[Pocketknife] "we require certain logistical concessions: anvils, a forge, seed of various varieties for planting, animals, tools. There is no other way but to bring this with us."

 "this is to say nothing of skilled tradesmen and the like, but we can work around that, These items you must grant us."

[BlackRobeRising] "I think you are getting a bit ahead of yourself, sir. We are willing to send some materials to help you get established but you have not yet proven you can take a suitable location and hold it, yet."

* Fabius_ sits up a bit. "We're planning an invasion on occupied land. We'll have a more accurate assessment of what we need when we know more on this Nubian situation.

[Fabius_] "To that end, what can you tell us of the capital city?"

* Kirveis looks up again, "My dear Felix, how could we even fit all of that onto one ship if they conceded? We shall return and fetch all we require."

[Pocketknife] "We require assurances that when we clear a colony, we won't be doomed to starvation when settlement time comes."

[BlackRobeRising] Alex chuckled, "As far as we are aware, the Nubians have kept the surrounding farms reasonable intact despite the incessant raids so food should not be a problem. We should be able to commit a few ships to carry supplies back and forth. The first round shall carry what you need, after that you'll need to make the appropriate purchases with what resources are available to you. Even now, we have had to focus on building up

  our military due to the tensions between the Athenian Empire and the Spartan Alliance."

[Pocketknife] "Got that Kirveis?"

 "Now, we need a site to claim."

* Fabius_ stands. "We have one. I propose that we strike the capital city."

 Kirveis is still carefully writing down all of these details, but nods all the same, certain that her memory is more than up to the task of remembering such minutiae for long enough to put them to parchment.

[Confernicus] "You intend for us to take a city?"

[Pocketknife] "It is ideally suited."

* Fabius_ steps forward, skirt brushing the stone floor. "I intend for us to infiltrate, sabotage, and conquer a small warband within a city."

[QuizzyQuin] I don't believe I've heard of a colonization start with a siege before.

[Confernicus] "Fabius, your ambitious, you have my support."

[Pocketknife] *test* 

[Euenthe] .roll 1d20

[dice-bot] Euenthe : 1d20 = 16 | [16] | 16 | 

[Pocketknife] test

[Fabius_] "We're dealing with at most two companies of actual Nubian warriors. He has hundreds of slaves," Fabius pauses, a slow smile rising. "But one master is as good as another. And a liberator is even better."

[Euenthe] "Wait… c.. capital?"

[BlackRobeRising] (It isn't a seige, the fortifications are in ruins as is most of the city. He has a couple hundred soldiers, hundreds of slaves working farms, and such.)

[Confernicus] "I believe my talents well be useful to this plan."

[BlackRobeRising] (He'd have to meet you in open battle, if you went that direction.)

[QuizzyQuin] (That's still a taking of a capital; so a partial siege)

* Euenthe looks concerned with the situation.

[Fabius_] (just to make sure we're on the same page: how many soldiers do we have?)

[QuizzyQuin] (Not as many)

[Pocketknife] (open battle is for suckers. I say decapitate.)

[QuizzyQuin] (*Not as many as the forces we'd be facing, I think)

[Confernicus] (But we do have specialists.)

[BlackRobeRising] (I think you have one mercenary company player? )

[Pocketknife] ?

[Fabius_] "My sources claim that they're stretched thin defending from beasts and marauders. We should have little trouble getting in and maintaining our cover."

[BlackRobeRising] [That is about ~1 company of troops if someone took that option]

[Pocketknife] "Alex, is their any further business to discuss?

 "

[Fabius_] (what options did everyone choose? I've got Information Broker, surprise surprise)

[Confernicus] (Religous leader)

[QuizzyQuin] (Master Artificers of magic items)

[Pocketknife] (religious order)

 oh,

[Euenthe] (um… Religious?)

[Kirveis] (Scholars)

[Euenthe] (wow)

 (three religious)

[Pocketknife] (well, I should somthing different then)

[BlackRobeRising] ( They stack, mostly, so up to you)

[Kirveis] (Mercenaries or merchants would be useful.)

[Pocketknife] 3 is excessive

[Fabius_] (maybe a bit excessive)

[Euenthe] (i'll be switching, don't worry)

[Pocketknife] Well, who keeps Religious order?

[Fabius_] (wait a sec, Confernicus' sheet says "Antitheistic". How is that religious?)

[Euenthe] (Ok, R&D it is)

 (for me)

[Confernicus] (I have an alternative church)

[Fabius_] (we already have R&D, I though)

[BlackRobeRising] (You can have a non-religion-religion)

[Pocketknife] pick something else and I will keep religion

[Confernicus] (believe it or not their are alot of non-theistic religions)

[Pocketknife] go magic or some such

 thats needed.

[Fabius_] (eh, if it's essential to his character)

[BlackRobeRising] (Nothing is 'needed')

[Confernicus] (It's kinda the back bone of my character concept and the only thing i might be able to work in is yet more R&D)

[Fabius_] (we have the power of religious zealotry on our side; we're unstoppable)

[BlackRobeRising] (Multiple religions have most of the benefits. The only draw back is the Major Temple power source bit)

 ('cause you need to split the 'power' three ways somehow

 or one of you just ignores it or whatever)

 ( Three religions would grow your population faster than one. You'd also have 3 groups of religious assosciations to draw from for people/allies)

[Fabius_] (would still be cool to have some Amazon warrior infantry)

 (nahmsayin)

[Euenthe] (yes it would, but without a temple of Artemis that will take much longer)

[BlackRobeRising] (So easiest solution is just to keep all three temples and share power. :P)

 (I can change the rules a little and just let you operate 3 temples at 'max power'. :P)

[Euenthe] (that's entirely up to you)

[BlackRobeRising] (Would let us get back to Rping so seems simplest, no?)

[Pocketknife] we can make our own pantheon.

[Confernicus] is two gods enough for a pantheon?

[Fabius_] (okay... how much would it cost to hire out mercenaries separately from that system, then?)

[Pocketknife] all the popular religions only have 2.

[BlackRobeRising] ( The only down is people with 'one temple' would be stronger than what I originally planned but not a big deal)

[Kirveis] (I'd be tossing in a couple minor deities to the mix for pantheon.)

[BlackRobeRising] (Fabius: Right, now you can't afford them. You'd need to assassinate the Nubian and basically break the morale of his army without one of your own.)

 (Doable,)

[Confernicus] (especially as i'm an assassin

[Fabius_] (aight, we can do that)

[QuizzyQuin] (And I'm a Bard with a very good Disguise skill)

[Euenthe] (I hit things when I'm angry)

[Pocketknife] anyway.

[Fabius_] (had I known that everyone was going sneaky social butterfly, I would not have made this kind of Rogue)

[BlackRobeRising] ( xD )

[Euenthe] (lets get back to the session)

[BlackRobeRising] (Ya.)

 [Fabius_] "My sources claim that they're stretched thin defending from beasts and marauders. We should have little trouble getting in and maintaining our cover."

 [BlackRobeRising] [That is about ~1 company of troops if someone took that option]

 [Pocketknife] "Alex, is their any further business to discuss?

  "

[Pocketknife] "Alex, is there anything else we need to discuss before we finalize this document and order copies made for signing?"

[BlackRobeRising] Alex shook his head. "Just wanted to be sure you understood the terms before you left was all, gentleman and ladies."

 He approached the dais calmly and placed a copy of the scrolls he had brought with him under his robes, one per person, and left them with the group. "Just leave them with the harbormaster before you leave."

[Pocketknife] "Ladies and Gentlemen, I suggest we make copies for safekeeping."

[Confernicus] "Agreed"

[Euenthe] (we're supposed to sign them right?)

* Fabius_ reads over the scroll. (Anything notable, or just what we agreed to?)

[Pocketknife] "2 copies plus the original per person ought to do."

[BlackRobeRising] (You are supposed to sign them, and it is pretty much what you agreed to. They weren't trying to trick you in anyway. They are a bit desperate to expand 'cause WAR COMING)

[Pocketknife] (who can make the best copies, btw)

[BlackRobeRising] ( If anyone has a fixed ending time, let me know. Also we've got two ways to go from here. More envoys. Or you guys decide to ignore further requests for meetings, board your ship, and head out to where you want to go.)

[Pocketknife] we can hear more envoys from other cultures?

* Euenthe takes her copy of the charter but hesitates for a few moments.

[BlackRobeRising] (Yes. There are several in town.)

 (w ould you like the list?)

[Pocketknife] (yes)

 (We should take the meetings or just go?)

[Fabius_] (still waiting on the list)

[Confernicus] (I'd like to make more meetings)

* Kirveis volunteers to make copies while beginning the process of signing each copy of the charter in a florid script which must be her native tongue, checking that the wording on each is identical and matches the agreed policies as she does.

[Confernicus] (particularly with anyone with more infor on this neubian capital

[Euenthe] (my char has little opinion, but she'll pass out if she's in another one of those)

[BlackRobeRising] ( Ambassador of the Holy Church of Babylon, The House of Bacchus [similar charter, different city-state, is going to go colonize like you are, an Envoy of Sparta,  an envoy named Tyrion from another similar expedition and an Envoy of Athens], 

[Kirveis] (And I suddenly find myself voting for heading on down to the ship...)

[Pocketknife] (We should take meetings will all of them?)

[Fabius_] (we should meet our rivals!)

[Confernicus] (I agree)

[Fabius_] ("Have fun storming the haunted mines!")

[Pocketknife] (can we get them in summation, we will pretty much drill the same points)

[BlackRobeRising] (Well, do you want to just get OOC summations then is what you are saying?)

[Pocketknife] "We should adjurn to the middle of a field."

 "...to talk privately."

[Fabius_] (I think that OOC we're all kind of itching to move to the boat)

[Confernicus] (I'm not really)

[Fabius_] (but IC we'd want to meet with the other envoys)

[Pocketknife] (we should see the differences in offers, etc)

[BlackRobeRising] ( You can always meet them later. They'll come later after you take the city.)

 (So official vote, Boat or Envoy, if you would)

[Confernicus] (Envoy)

[Euenthe] (boat)

* Kirveis is wary of meeting with envoys from Athens or Sparta, but not could be seen as an insult. Furthermore, now might be the most convenient time to meet with the other charter-colonies, and maybe set up trade agreements.

[Pocketknife] (envoy)

[Kirveis] (OOC: boat, IC: envoys)

[QuizzyQuin] (uh,)

[Fabius_] (Boat. No point making trade agreements with nonexistent colonies)

 (we can make those agreements when we know what we need)

[Pocketknife] (we can go boat, I am not tied to it)

[QuizzyQuin] (Boat)

[Kirveis] (*ties Pocket to the boat*)

[BlackRobeRising] (Boat it is. Do you want to skip the sea journey and arrive at your destination which I believe is the Old Capital?)

[Fabius_] (not entirely)

[QuizzyQuin] (Is there much importance to the Sea journey?)

[Fabius_] (this boat and crew and captain are our men, right? Not just our one way trip?)

[Pocketknife] We should take copies of the rights to our lands at store one in a bank here in the city, and take the original in nice containers with us. Leave a copy with the dock.

[BlackRobeRising] (No. The Athenians haven't threatened you yet so they won't attack you yet.)

 (The captain and crew have been paid and fed for 90 days to assist and obey you by order of Argos.)

 (So they are your men unless you stop paying them.)

[Fabius_] (how long is the trip?)

[Pocketknife] (how much $/mo upkeep on them?)

[BlackRobeRising] (It'll eat up a d10 of your income)

[Fabius_] (we can work that part out later; I just want to know how long we have them after we make land)

[BlackRobeRising] (The journey is about 8 days.)

[Fabius_] (sweet)

[BlackRobeRising] (So you'd have them for the full season and you can decide to release them or pay them next season)

[Kirveis] (Will be helpful to know how income and everything works, but that can wait until the warlord is dead and we're ready to start establishing colony!)

[BlackRobeRising] (Yes, I was going to go over that when we do the season skip after the warlord + envoys

 (So you guys want to skip to arrival then?)

  (Or rp the travel with each other?)

[Pocketknife] (arrival, scout, basecamp?)

[QuizzyQuin] (I'd be fine either way)

[Euenthe] (i'm for either, the seas can be treacherous)

* Fabius_ spends most of the trip above deck with the crew, comparing tattoos, gambling, pranking. Occasionally slipping below decks hand in hand with one.

[BlackRobeRising] (I'm assuming Fabius likes the boys then.)

[Fabius_] (Fabius isn't picky)

[BlackRobeRising] (Eh, lets just skip if it is either or :P)

* Confernicus spends the trip alone mostly, observing the party memebers form a distance, particularly fabius.)

[BlackRobeRising] (Also, I don't want Fabius RPing the fact he is tapping every NPC crewmember and testing their stamina ;) )

[Fabius_] (but relax, I'm not going to write porn for you all)

[Pocketknife] (allying them to our cause?)

[dice-bot] BlackRobeRising : 1d20 [height] = 15 | [15] | 15 [height] | 

[Euenthe] that's low at least

 the first one

[BlackRobeRising] All you have noticed that your companion, Euenthe, has grown a full cup size and is about 15" taller than he was before over the course of the ship's journey. None of you know why.

* Kirveis keeps a careful log of our journey, recording notable events each day, but mostly keeps to herself, whereas her familiar, Bephnora, is far more outgoing and happy to play her flute for the sailors.

[Fabius_] (he?)

[BlackRobeRising] *she

 (Typos and genders. xD)

[Fabius_] (basically, learning about our crew and captain)

 (that blurb was the RP side of it)

* Euenthe keeps to herself and every once in a while you notice her adjusting her clothing… which no longer fits anymore

[Euenthe] at least not very well

[BlackRobeRising] * Really what? :P )

 ( Anyone else want to make skill checks before you arrive at your destination? )

[Pocketknife] Sure, geo

[dice-bot] Fabius_ : 1d20+11 [Perception to notice Euenthe's growth] = 14 | [3] | 3+11 [Perception to notice Euenthe's growth] | 

[Fabius_] (... Euenthe's been really sneaky)

[BlackRobeRising] (Pocketknife: Quizzy: Kirveis: You have a general idea of the region's terrain. It is one of the places where the Nile hits the sea, and the water in the region is generally brackish to full sea water. The target is safely located on an island but that island is poorly suited to growing food due to the limited fresh water supplies from small streams created by regular rainfalls. The city ruins itself have little value be

 sides rubble, although there is housing for the local warlord's troops and slaves. His slaves spend most of their time farming what little practical land was available on the island for the practice. That and logging the local forest or quarry to start rebuilding the city. The continent itself is crawling with monsters but the Isle rarely suffers more than viking-style raids from the more intelligent monsters [e.g. Gobli

 ns])

[Euenthe] (for a now 6ft tall woman with a d-cup...)

[Pocketknife] (we should attempt to make it to the island unseen.

[QuizzyQuin] (massk stealth check for the ship?)

[BlackRobeRising] ( You'd need to use the Captain's skills for that, I don't think any of you are professional sailors?)

[Pocketknife] Can someone cast fog or some such to aid?

* Fabius_ occasionally joins the captain and his officers for Greek wine. They drink regularly.

[Confernicus] (he captain is)

[Fabius_] (any part of the island easier to approach?)

[BlackRobeRising] (Fabius, did you bugger the captain as well? :P)

[Fabius_] (I thought you didn't want to know)

[Pocketknife] we should of course do it in the dead of night, and time our arrival for moonless night.

[BlackRobeRising] (I'd like to keep track of how many NPCs you sleep with for STD rolls)

 ( https://github.com/BlackRobeRising/colonists-player-notes/blob/master/Regions/LocalMap.png basically what you know if the area, the you are here bit is where the city ruins you are aiming for is located )

[dice-bot] [ colonists-player-notes/Regions/LocalMap.png at master · BlackRobeRising/colonists-player-notes · GitHub ] - https://github.com

[BlackRobeRising] (There are a couple obvious bays on the estern and north eastern ends of the island, so those would be easiest)

[Fabius_] (the answer is probably yes to STDs at some point, BRR; this character has been a slave, a prostitute, a pimp, a thief, and is now a spymaster)

[BlackRobeRising] (Yes, but I'm assuming you are clean when you started the character. So knowing how many ship folk you went through gives me a fort save to work with :P)

[Kirveis] "Let's aim for one of the bays on the northeastern side of the island. I can mask our approach with illusions so that we're less likely to be noticed, and then we can make our way to the city and deal with the soldiers, hopefully a dozen or so at a time."

[QuizzyQuin] (It's going to annoy me until I ask, but was there any importance to what happened with Euthene?)

[Fabius_] "If we're using illusions, I have a wand we might make use of."

[Kirveis] (I was thinking of casting Silent Image to make the ship look like a low-flying flock of birds. I can affect 11 10-ft cubes.)

[Fabius_] (she's growing larger, that's all. She's eventually going to become Large)

 (I have a wand of it)

[QuizzyQuin] (Alrighty)

[BlackRobeRising] (It'll take a couple castings of that, Fabius.)

 (And that falls under a visual screen of some kind, so anyone who sees it will get a will save because Silent Image isn't going to be re-create the sounds0

[Kirveis] (We don't need to mask the whole ship, just the masts and sails that can be seen far off.)

[BlackRobeRising] (Alright, so one casting and anyone close enough would notice.)

[Kirveis] (So, we just need to not fail our Perception checks.)

[BlackRobeRising] (A ship is alot easier to spot than a person. ALOT easier.)

 (So group plan is  Northeastern bay, under the cover of one illusion. Any objections?)

[Fabius_] (I have 3 uses of Ghost Sound, which might help)

[QuizzyQuin] (I'm assuming the bays are the black spots on the map.

[Kirveis] (The black spots are ruins.)

[BlackRobeRising] (Black spots are city ruins)

[QuizzyQuin] (And is there anything on deck that could help with the illusion spell?)

[BlackRobeRising] (There isn't Quizzy)

[QuizzyQuin] (Alright.)

[BlackRobeRising] (The bays I'm talking about are the places where the water seems to eat into the island more than in other places)

[QuizzyQuin] (Ya.)

[BlackRobeRising] (Its a relatively flat island with some forests in the middle)

[Kirveis] (Actually, Bephnora will help out with illusion, so 22 10-ft cubes worth of illusionary birds.)

 (Forgot she can cast Silent Image too.)

[Fabius_] (wait, can you cast Ghost Sound?)

 (it's a cantrip, so you should be able to do it continuously)

[Kirveis] (Nope, can't cast spells while maintaining a Silent Image.)

[Fabius_] (if I use my wand and Bephnora uses her ability, we can provide the gull cover)

 (while you provide the noise)

[QuizzyQuin] (I knew I should have taken Ghost Sound as one of my 0-level spells)

[Fabius_] (I accept that this will drain the wand considerably)

[Pocketknife] (for a city, its probably a good trade)

[Kirveis] (If you're okay with it, then that's what I'll do.)

[BlackRobeRising] (So you guys are using a combination of Ghost Sound and Silent Image to emulate a flock of gulls for anyone looking at the ship shoreward)

[Fabius_] (yup!)

[Kirveis] (Yep, and we can now cover the whole ship.)

[Pocketknife] (I have eyes on the island w/ remote viewing, I will let you know of any activity)

[BlackRobeRising] ( Just realize unless he gets super lucky, he'll only see someone with a torch or the like)

[Pocketknife] (least we know if they see us)

[BlackRobeRising] The ship approaches the island under the cover of darkness and its illusions. This was not the perfect deception since, after all, seabirds rarely flocked in large numbers so close to the ocean floor in the dead of night. However, most people who are used to the ocean and its nature would find it strange nevertheless [skill check+will check]. The captain doused the lanterns to help cover your approach and avoid any furth

 er potential signs of a ship entering an unused harbor.

[Pocketknife] (unload the company and dig in for a "seige")

 ?

* Fabius_ burns away the wand's power maintaining a flimsy lie until we reach shore or are attacked with burning arrows.

[Kirveis] (Wait, we have a company?)

[Pocketknife] yes?

[Kirveis] (I thought it was just us and the sailors.)

* Euenthe prepares for the worst.

[BlackRobeRising] ( Did any of you take the mercenary company option? )

[Fabius_] (don't we have religious nuts following us or something?)

[Euenthe] ( I don't think so )

[BlackRobeRising] ( None of you are we aware you were detected. )

 ( The religious people have a few adepts and such but not really soldiers. )

 ( Basically, you've got like 5 guys who can cast Sleep once a day.)

[Euenthe] ( BlackRobeRising, my character is preparing for the worst in general )

[Confernicus] (\o/ fuck insomnia)

[BlackRobeRising] ( 3 of you went religion, ya?)

[Pocketknife] (yeah.)

[QuizzyQuin] (Inspirational speech?)

[Fabius_] (have we hit land yet?)

[BlackRobeRising] You are capable of landing, yes. You haven't disembarked.)

[Kirveis] (How far is it, approximately, from landing site to city, time-wise? Like... 3-4 hour hike?)

[BlackRobeRising] ( More like 3-4 days on horse )

[Fabius_] (... aw fuck. We should have tried to bluff our way in as merchants or something)

[BlackRobeRising] (Each hex represents ~1 day of travel by sea or by horse)

[Fabius_] (we don't even have horses)

[Pocketknife] (we should make for the hill and fortify.

[Euenthe] (probably)

[BlackRobeRising] (So about a week by land...but you don't know you've been spotted or by whom)

[Euenthe] (exit the ship as quietly as possible?)

[Pocketknife] either way we need a camp.

[BlackRobeRising] ( You could always try to arrive and try to bluff your way in too :P Its not like they'd recognize your exact ship in the dead of night.)

[Pocketknife] worst case, we have to go guerilla warfare.

[QuizzyQuin] (I have amazing Bluff)

[Pocketknife] (thats cool too)

[BlackRobeRising] ( I'm just amused how paranoid you are when you don't even know if it is just some escaped slave hiding out where the city patrols won't find him. xD )

 ( And the remote viewing didn't even reveal you were observed. )

[Pocketknife] (what about my actions hasn't been paranoid from the start?)

 lol

[BlackRobeRising] (Seems legit.)

[Fabius_] (good call. as far as we know, it's a brilliant plan that didn't fail)

* Kirveis will reinforce her exceptionally light armour by girding herself in pure force, just in case, and then will go ahead and head ashore to survey a likely place to set up camp that we can fortify.

[BlackRobeRising] (Is anyone joining her before I respond with how this goes?)

[Fabius_] "I don't think it's necessary to bring the whole crew. How many of you lot can fight, and how many would for the promise of gold and glory?"

[Pocketknife] there are only 2 companies. How many do you think we have to kill  before the rest flee?

[Fabius_] "Precisely. We can signal the crew to land when we need them again."

 (anyone have Dancing Lights?)

[QuizzyQuin] (I have light)

[Fabius_] (not really the same)

[Pocketknife] no, but I can use divination to get some answer to a question...

[BlackRobeRising] The Captain replied to Fabius calmly, "Frankly, we are here to do a job. We will leave if the odds are unreasonable but my crew have fought off pirates before. Just understand, we are simple sailors....not heavily armed warriors. We have a few weapons but merely leather armor."

[Confernicus] (we can probably start a more traditional lightshow)

[Kirveis] (I didn't prepare Dancing Lights today.)

[Fabius_] (but you know it?)

[Kirveis] (Bephnora, however, can cast it at will.)

[Pocketknife] (nice.)

[Kirveis] (Just make sure you ask her nicely.)

[BlackRobeRising] (So just remember, you are dealing with a decently capable expert [the captain] and 39 sailors plus 15 adepts. You've basically got 55% of one company of troops to fight with. Admittedly, 15 of them can do some damage with massed sleep spells.)

[Fabius_] (she'll need to let us know that)

[BlackRobeRising] Kirveis stumbled about, breaking branches and generally making a mess of her attempt at stealth.

 (So I'm taking it the party is going ashore and the rest stay on the ship. Correct?)

[Fabius_] (is she not going to let the captain know the signal to come back and get us?)

 (Kirvy should do that)

 (no one else can signal, after all)

[Kirveis] (Kirveis can just swim out to the ship if she has to. Would almost be as fast as walking, but then her clothes would get soaked.)

[BlackRobeRising] Is Kirveis going alone to the shore or ?)

[Fabius_] (... okay, the idea was to send the ship back out to hang out where they won't get caught, and we can signal them back with dancing lights in the sky)

[Pocketknife] then we just hide somewhere for a while?

[Fabius_] (yes. We do recon of the area)

[Euenthe] (I'm sworn to protect Pocketknife so I go where he goes."

 )*

[Kirveis] (We can do that then. We should take a sailor with us to row the away boat back to the ship. And Kirveis goes with rest of party.)

 (She just totally bumbles her stealth when she gets there.)

[Euenthe] (as do I, dealing with the changes)

[Fabius_] "We're better off if you lot stay out at sea while we explore to see if it's safe." Fabius looks at the Azata perched near Kirveis. "She can signal you with those lights in the sky she makes."

[BlackRobeRising] The Captain nodded at the request, "I can stay a decent distance offshore but it'll take at least a couple hours, weather permitting, for my crew and I to arrive if you need us."

 (Are you taking any of your adepts?)

[Fabius_] (Meh, why not?)

[Pocketknife] we should take them I think.

[BlackRobeRising] (Bigger groups are less...stealthy)

 (And none of them would have ranks in Stealth)

[Euenthe] (just leave them behind, the more of us there are, the less likely we can bluff our way out of this)

[BlackRobeRising] (It would be things like Knowledge: Religon, Spellcraft, etc)

[Confernicus] (I'm not taking mine, they are instructed to find me if something goes wrong."

* Fabius_ goes down below decks to pack, and returns with a hefty wicker backpack and a leather satchel.

[BlackRobeRising] (The only real thing they offer that you don't have is the ability to casting Obscuiring Mist in case you need to run)

[Pocketknife] I have obsuring mist

[Kirveis] (Um... I have that spell checked as memorized.)

[BlackRobeRising] ( Can you cast it 15 times?)

[Kirveis] (... no.)

[Pocketknife] i also have gaseous form, which can be cast on anyone

[BlackRobeRising] (That is what I meant, if you needed to create a massive fog or put down like 15 people to sleep :P)

[Kirveis] (I also have Feather Fall memorized, because you NEVER know.)

[Confernicus] Poketknife your my temporary best friend

[Fabius_] A shortsword is buckled to the rope belt around his tunic, his hair is bound up in a topknot, and a shortbow is strung around one shoulder.

 (a massive fog would have been much better cover...)

[BlackRobeRising] (Not really. It would be just as suspicious since it only covers like 300' in all directions or so)

 (Fogs are generally y'know, larger than that)

[Fabius_] (oh well)

[BlackRobeRising] ( Just assume any trick to hide you is going to run into will save + perception checks :P)

[Fabius_] (which Nubians will always crush. We're in trouble)

 (should nicked that necromancer)

[BlackRobeRising] ( Well, if it is an illusion. xD )

 ( Anyway. )

 (All ready to land on shore?)

[Fabius_] (ready)

[Confernicus] Damn, I should have played a necromancer, tatical zombie armies FTW

 (Ready)

[Pocketknife] ready

[Euenthe] (ready as well)

[QuizzyQuin] (You guys are worried, this is exactly why Inspire Courage is necessary)

[BlackRobeRising] ( XDD Oh, bards)

[QuizzyQuin] (What else am I suppose to do? Dance?)

[Confernicus] (bards, totally out of touch with reality, end up with crowns and women anyway.)

[Kirveis] "Should we start heading inland then? March under cover of darkness, sleep during the day?"

[BlackRobeRising] The two crewman in your boat began rowing with paddles muffled with by blankets where they might strike the boat. The boat itself is a dark, almost black, blue color that should make detection difficult. You seem to arrive at the sandy shoreline without any obvious difficulty.

[Kirveis] (Ah well, was worth trying.)

[Euenthe] -_-

[BlackRobeRising] (Anyway, continue with whatever you are doing as you move on shore :) )

* Euenthe watches the darkness as best she can, waiting for anything to pounce on them.

 Fabius_ steps out from the shore, stringing his bow and keeping an eye out for any light or smoke.

[Kirveis] (So, what's our plan?)

[BlackRobeRising] (Idk, so I'm waiting patiently for you guys to pick one :) )

[Pocketknife] explore I thought was the plan?

[QuizzyQuin] (We're moving onto shore, looking for a defendible camp right?)

* Fabius_ waves for the others. "Come on. We need to explore the surrounding area. Look for a road."

[BlackRobeRising] The land seemed quiet in the twilight, despite the unnerving sense of being watched. The moonless night, however, still provided the perfect cover for your activities.

[Kirveis] "Okay, we'll head inland. It's a big island, we should be fine."

[Euenthe] "i hope so… they could be anywhere."

[Fabius_] "Or nowhere. So let's find out."

[QuizzyQuin] "It's nothing we couldn't handle as a group."

[Fabius_] (anything of note around us?)

[BlackRobeRising] (Heading directly towards the city ruins then or somewhere else?)

[Fabius_] (in that direction until we find a road or something)

[BlackRobeRising] (Its basically flat grassland, good grazing quality. You are aware of a forest about a day from you.)

[Fabius_] (boom)

[BlackRobeRising] (Yep.)

[Confernicus] (Sic me on em)

* Fabius_ motions for the group to stop and be silent, listening.

 Euenthe stops

 Confernicus does so

[BlackRobeRising] Fabius saw a young olive skinned male carefully crouched in the grass about sixty feet from the group's position. He seemed to be quietly observing the group and moving as slowly as he could to avoid detection. However, in trying to figure out where you went after you left the ship he stumbled and fell on his face and couldn't help but curse. It was barely loud enough for Fabius to hear but the moment he heard it was obv

 ious, damned obvious where the young man was. 

* Fabius_ moves toward the sound, motioning for others to follow.

[Confernicus] (I can kill him real quick)

[BlackRobeRising] The young male, maybe 15, was dressed in little more than fine clothes that had torn in a dozen places.

* Kirveis comes to a complete stop and looks around, her ears twitching for whatever sound her compatriot heard.

 Confernicus does so

 Euenthe follows

[Kirveis] (What if he's just a slave?)

[Confernicus] (I can immobilize him)

[QuizzyQuin] (You could always capture him for interrogation)

[Pocketknife] (incapacitate and question)

[BlackRobeRising] The man stands up but the party had moved close enough to keep up with him if he tried to bolt. He tried anyway. He turned and ran.

* Euenthe keeps close to Pocketknife as well

[Confernicus] I bolt after him

 And I think i'm going to catch him

 40 ft move speed

* Fabius_ snaps his fingers, and moves at a ludicrous speed. (Expeditious Retreat)

[BlackRobeRising] Conferenicus slowly closes the distance on the man who was fleeing. [Gains 20' a round on him, so in 2 rounds you'd catch him] However, Fabius starts to close it faster. [You'd catch up with Conferenicus due to the delay of casting the spell]

* Euenthe "Eh, wait…" she looks at Pocketknife wondering why they just ran off.

[Confernicus] I'm studying his movements through all of this

[BlackRobeRising] The boy is simply running for his life, it appears. [Double move action every round]

[Confernicus] Class feature

 it allows me to get a bonus if i study for 3 rounds

[Fabius_] "Keep running if you want to die," Fabius calls in Nubian. "Stop and speak with us if you'd like to live."

* Fabius_ draws his shortsword. "It's your choice."

[BlackRobeRising] [It has been 2 rounds, so you are waiting a 3rd round before catching him?]

[Confernicus] wait nvm thats a standard action

* QuizzyQuin tries to keep up.

[Confernicus] cant cahse while i do that now

 i'll have to rely on plan B

[BlackRobeRising] The boy hears the words but doesn't understand him and keeps trying to run, scared of the short sword.

[Fabius_] (plan B: Wrasslin')

* Fabius_ repeats himself in Masadan

[BlackRobeRising] [He is olive skinned, so he has to be Masadan, Greek, or Atlantian]

[QuizzyQuin] (I meant tries to keep up for the previous part)

[Confernicus] (Plan: B break some bones)

[BlackRobeRising] [Nubian = Dark black, like the traditional african 'look' so to speak]

* Kirveis will give chase as well, her form vanishing and reappearing constantly. (+15' movement per round)

[Confernicus] "Don't kill him, i'd like to know who he's working for"

[BlackRobeRising] The boy freezes and stops running at the threat. There were too many and too fast and they spoke a language he understood. Maybe, maybe he had a chance. "Fuck you, slavers!"

[Confernicus] "cute"

* Euenthe asks Pocketknife, "Should we really just be standing here?"

[Kirveis] "We're not slavers!"

[Confernicus] "Who are you working for"

* Fabius_ stops short. And then he laughs. "Slavers? Not likely. What are you doing out here?"

[Pocketknife] Euenthe, you can hurry if you want, I have to make progress at my stately 20ft/rd

[Euenthe] same...

[Pocketknife] I assume by the time we catch up, they will have him

[Euenthe] ( most likely )

[Pocketknife] and then I force the truth out of him

[BlackRobeRising] The young man they ran down frowned and said, "Bounty hunters then? I'm not going back to getting my ass raped every night, so if you are hoping to turn me in for a profit. Just slit my throat now."

 "The price on escaped slaves is the same alive or dead."

[Confernicus] "Shut up, I'm asking the questions, Who are you working for, why are you watching us?"

[BlackRobeRising] "Strange men arriving in the middle of the night so close to where I hide? Why wouldn't I keep an eye on the situation?"

[Confernicus] "Who do you report to?"

* Fabius_ gives Confernicus a sidelong look. "Didn't you hear him? He's a runaway. Come along, dear, we're not bounty hunters either. We're here to free you."

[Confernicus] "Do you hold any loyalties?"

 "You of all people should know, runaways and other undesirables make the best eyes and ears."

[BlackRobeRising] He ignored Confernicus and turned to Fabius, "Free me? Seriously? Just leave me in peace. I'm safe enough as long as no one finds me out here."

* Fabius_ grins. "Do they come out here often?"

 Kirveis eyes his clothing and asks, "Do you really want to live in rags in the wild all the rest of your life?"

[BlackRobeRising] He eyed Confernicus, "No. I am not going back there. Rather slit my own throat."

[QuizzyQuin] Perhaps if you help us, we can help you in another way?

 (I always forget the quotations)

[Confernicus] "I have no interest in runaway neubian slaves, I spill noble blood, not hunt mass bounties."

[Kirveis] "Maybe, instead of slitting your own throat, you could help us slit theirs?"

[BlackRobeRising] The boys eyes narrowed at the veiled offer of a bribe from Kirveis. He liked the idea of better clothes but there was no way in hell he was going to risk his freedom for them. Years of being raped roughly in the ass, tied down in a stockade, was not worth.

 *worth it

 (Guys, he isn't Nubian. Nubian are black. He has olive skin. It would be common knowledge ].]"

 )

[Confernicus] He's a salve of the Nubians

 slave*

[BlackRobeRising] (Just being clear but every time you bring up Nubians you kinda irk the guy.)

[Fabius_] (hold on, we were cringing about my character's implied consensual sex, but we're going in-depth on rape camps?)

[QuizzyQuin] (When were you talking about consensual sex?)

[BlackRobeRising] ( Not cringing. I'm trying to figure out the fort save I need to give you.)

[Confernicus] (on the boat)

[Fabius_] (see? it was subtle)

 (read up on that necklace, buddy. I see zero fort saves necessary)

[Pocketknife] (lets enlist his help

[Confernicus] "What's your name boy?"

[Pocketknife] perhaps he can help sneak us in

[BlackRobeRising] (That was after I asked 'bout Fabius :P )

[Pocketknife] in exchange for not being raped in the ass

[Confernicus] Make a man from nothing and you own that man

[BlackRobeRising] The boy frowned, "Slit theirs? I hardly have the skills or any weapons to speak of. What is it you want, exactly?"

[Kirveis] "Look, in a few days' time, we'll be the ones running the island, and there won't be any slaves. You can keep hiding out here, or you can come with us and live free. I'll even see about that clothing in the morning, if it's not beyond all hope."

[QuizzyQuin] .roll 1d20+15 Bluff

[dice-bot] QuizzyQuin : 1d20+15 Bluff = 19 | [4] | 4+15 Bluff | 

[Confernicus] "No weapons, not from you at least."

 "We need information"

[BlackRobeRising] "What kind of information?"

[Fabius_] (quizz, what bluff are you rolling for?)

[BlackRobeRising] (I'm assuming whatever he says next)

[Confernicus] "Anything you can give"

[QuizzyQuin] "If you help us find a way back from where you came, we will repay you greatly"

[Fabius_] "We need to get into the capital. We need to know who runs it, and where he lives. We need to know where the guards are, and where they go."

 "Do any come out this way?"

[QuizzyQuin] (Uh, I don't know...)

[Kirveis] "Look, we can interrogate him while we move. We have lots of ground to cover still. Boy, are you coming with us? You're not going back into chains as long as we're alive."

[Confernicus] (Can we afford to leave him here, he knows too much to not be supervised)

[Fabius_] (may as well let him think he has a choice in the matter)

[BlackRobeRising] "The guards do come out this way every so often. There are four patrols that move throughout the island but given the distances, they are only passing through once every few days and rather quickly at that. I'll come up with you for some decent clothes, the promise of freedom, a book, some ink, and a decent quarterstaff."

[Kirveis] (He doesn't need to know he doesn't have a choice.)

[Confernicus] (Fair enough)

 "Is that all you want? I expected ambition."

 "Very well, it's a deal"

[QuizzyQuin] "Do you want him to ask for more"

 ("?")

[Kirveis] (A book is a lot to ask for.)

[BlackRobeRising] "I'll be happy to have a chained guard or two for me to bugger with that quarterstaff as well, since you mentioned it."

[Confernicus] (Perhaps i do, the hungry ones are useful)

 (Kirveis but far from beyond our reach.)

 "We'll see"

[BlackRobeRising] ( Does no one want to roll sense motive as to why an ex-slave is asking for a book? :P )

[Confernicus] (Kirveis your a wizard don't you have one?"

[BlackRobeRising] Quizzy and Confernicus: You both have the sense that giving the slave a book and something to write in it with would not be the best idea, but you aren't sure why.

[QuizzyQuin] You'll get that book after you help us with what we ask.

[BlackRobeRising] The slave frowned at that. "Why not now? It is not like I can outrun you."

[QuizzyQuin] Why do you need the book specifically?

[Kirveis] (Of course I have books, back in my trunk aboard the ship. He's not getting my spellbooks.)

[Confernicus] "Because it's an odd request."

[BlackRobeRising] .roll 1d20+5

[dice-bot] BlackRobeRising : 1d20+5 = 21 | [16] | 16+5 | 

[Kirveis] "Why do you need it right now? It's the middle of the night."

* Confernicus whispers to Quizy "the boys a wizard."

[BlackRobeRising] "Well, frankly, I miss having a journal to write in. I used to write the day's events into it every night before bed. You seemed to be wealthy enough to have one or two. A few pages of parchment would do for now I suppose..."

[BlackRobeRising] He paused for a bit.

 "It would give me a sense of normalcy I've been missing."

[QuizzyQuin] (Dat Nat 1)

[Euenthe] "Can't we just giving his book so we can move on already?" she says, looking around and being a bit impatient about having made so much noise and stayed in the same spot.

[BlackRobeRising] [Fabius: You are completely 100% convinced it is security blanket and he needs it more than anything else in the world. He won't help you without it.]

 [Confernicus: You aren't convinced to that degree but he seems completely genuine.]

[Fabius_] "We don't have books lying around. But there must be books in the city."

[QuizzyQuin] .roll 1d20+15 bluff

[dice-bot] QuizzyQuin : 1d20+15 bluff = 26 | [11] | 11+15 bluff | 

[QuizzyQuin] "I have a blank book with me for you to write in, but I will give it to you later."

* Kirveis fetches out her personal journal, in which she's been keeping a log of our expedition, and tears out a single page from the very back to hand to the boy, "Look, you can use my quill and ink when we stop to rest."

[Pocketknife] (I am starting to think this kid needs to come down with a case of the slit throats...)

[Fabius_] (oh god. You've just given the kid Expeditious Retreat!)

[QuizzyQuin] (That was such a good bluff too)

[BlackRobeRising] [PocketKnife: You are pretty sure he is up to something with his requests. You aren't sure if it is the book specifically or something else.]

* Confernicus whispers to kerveis "keep track of what he writes, I know how to smell a wizard."

[QuizzyQuin] (lol "I know how to smell a wizard")

[Confernicus] Fabius_, you'll have to cast expedious retreat on me then

[BlackRobeRising] The boy takes the page from Kirveis in gratitude and takes a slight bow. "Thank you Master Kirveis, I'm much apologized."

[Kirveis] "I most emphatically do -not- smell, nor would I allow you to demonstrate your methods!"

[BlackRobeRising] (So any destination in mind or you just going to setup camp on the open grassland?)

[Pocketknife] highground? forest?

[Kirveis] (As far as we can get. I would prefer near a tree.)

[Fabius_] "What is your name, boy?"

* Confernicus whispers back "I'm an assassin of a specific specialty, that is all I mean."

[BlackRobeRising] (Forest you can manage within a day)

[Kirveis] (To the forest then!)

[BlackRobeRising] (The only 'high round' is slight rises which don't really qualify as a hill and would just make you more visible, not less)

[QuizzyQuin] (I agree, Forest!)

[Fabius_] (I'm about done, guys)

 (can we figure this out next time?)

[BlackRobeRising] (Ya, I'm planning to stop once you reach the forest and setup camp :P)

[Fabius_] (to the forest!)

[Euenthe] (agreed)

[Confernicus] (3 am)

[BlackRobeRising] The party reached the outskirts of the forest safely enough and were able to start setting up camp. The ex-slave was secretive about whatever he was writing down as you settle in to rest.

 (We'll end here, and figure out watches at the start of the next. Sorry I was late guys :/)

[Euenthe] np

[BlackRobeRising] ( I kinda knocked out from the meds from my appt. :/)

[QuizzyQuin] (Don't worry about it

[BlackRobeRising] (Feel free to consider tonight over if you need to go :) )

 ( I assume everyone is fine with me posting session logs on Github? )

[Confernicus] yeah

[Euenthe] yep

[Confernicus] (Boy's definetly a wizard, or worse.)

* Kirveis allows the boy to have some ink and a quill once we pick  where to camp. She collects both of them when he's done writing, then heads up into a tree to coil around a sturdy limb nice and high up.

[Euenthe] (so, any campside RP those remaining would like to do?)

[BlackRobeRising] (I'll be up for a wee bit longer if you guys want to do some campside RP)

[QuizzyQuin] ( That was a waste of a bluff roll.)

[Pocketknife] I am gonna crash. Have a nice night

[Confernicus] (anyone know sleep?)

[Fabius_] (I'd like to give this kid a name)

 (otherwise I'm just calling him Harry)

[Euenthe] lol

[QuizzyQuin] (Call him Harold

[Fabius_] ('cause "Yer a wizard, 'arry")

* Euenthe moves a semi-large create to her side of the camp.

[Euenthe] crate*

[Fabius_] (she's been carrying a crate this whole time?)

[QuizzyQuin] (Where di that come from?)

[Euenthe] (actually, no I wouldn't have)

 (I'd have some vials with me though)

 (used to having things that carry your crud, or bags of holding)

* QuizzyQuin plays some campfire tunes withh his suitar

[Fabius_] (what happened to our Elif and his never ending water supply?)

[BlackRobeRising] ( His name is Evel btw )

[Fabius_] (cool)

[BlackRobeRising] (He hasn't told you yet)

 ( And I think he quit 'cause he felt we weren't getting along )

* Euenthe drinks one of her potions.

[QuizzyQuin] (I'm going to Sense Motive that kid sooo much, just becaause of his name)

[BlackRobeRising] (But I didn't actually y'know, tell him to quit so idk if he will show up at some point. xD)

[Euenthe] ( I don't think he will unless I ask him about it )

[Fabius_] (Evel, the friendly and totally good slave who is not a wizard)

[BlackRobeRising] (Eh, we have enough players)

[Euenthe] ( I know )

 ( btw, what do those potions taste like? )

[BlackRobeRising] (Evel is soooooo not a wizard. )

[QuizzyQuin] (Of course not, why would he be a wizard?)

* QuizzyQuin stops playing campfire tunes "Anyone want to hear a few tales?"

[Fabius_] (he's only the descendent of wizards, who destroyed themselves with dark magic)

 (but yeah, I think I'm out now)

 ('night folks

[BlackRobeRising] ( Night Fabius)

[Euenthe] (gnight)

[-- Fabius_ has quit (Quit: Leaving)

[QuizzyQuin] (Night)

 (what I'm RPing right now is the extent of being a useful Bard)

[Kirveis] (He's a prince who was captured by slavers, and his fondest memory of freedom was learning to read and write.)

[BlackRobeRising] ( Clearly! )

--- Confernicus is now known as Spaaaace

[BlackRobeRising] ( So calling it a night then?)

--- Euenthe is now known as Emn1ty

[Kirveis] (Pretty sure it -is- a night. Except in Europe...)

[QuizzyQuin] (Did people change there Username to there character's name?)

[Emn1ty] Yes

[BlackRobeRising] (Most did, yes)

[QuizzyQuin] (Ya, I figured.)

[Emn1ty] (still want to know what the potions taste like, so I know how I should react to drinking them)

[BlackRobeRising] (It tastes like horse piss.)

[QuizzyQuin] (Delicious.)

[Emn1ty] (wonderful…)

[BlackRobeRising] ( I kid. )

[Kirveis] (Actually, Kingmaker established that many potions have bitter aftertastes.)

[BlackRobeRising] ( It tastes a bit foul but nothing truly unwholesome. Its like eating V8 made from veggies you hate )

[Emn1ty] (so my reaction would be semi audible)

[QuizzyQuin] (How do you change your name, so I know next time.)

 (It's from a silly british show)

[Emn1ty] (unless anyone is curious about the potions my character has been drinking for the entire trip, then my character just goes to sleep after she drinks her potion unless she's up for the first shift)

[BBR] (That is b/t you two)

[Emn1ty] (my armor most certainly does not fit anymore)

--- Spaaaace is now known as Spaaaace_ZzZ

[BBR] (Em can roll a sleight of hand or stealth to do it secretly if he likes)

[Emn1ty] (technically my character doesn't associate the two, so she wouldn't try to hide it)

[QuizzyQuin] (Time for stupid rp then)

[Kirveis] Wait, so is your character going to be going about bare naked?

[BBR] (Stupid RP?)

[Emn1ty] (all she was told was, "Drink this it'll help you in your adventure")

[BBR] She won't be going around naked.

[QuizzyQuin] (I don't know why I said that, I didn't mean to offend)

[BBR] Its more her she is going to have trouble fitting into her armor and such.

[QuizzyQuin] (Why would you trust a person that says "It'll help you in your adventure?)

 (That is the exact situation for a Sense Motive)

[Emn1ty] (because I trust them, at least I do at the moment. that may change down the line)

[QuizzyQuin] (Probably if you can't fit in any armor and use longswords like daggers)

[BBR] (None of you searched Evel right?)

[Emn1ty] (I'll just have to get different armor, and they gave me large sized weapons which my character doesn't really understand why. She just assumes she was given what they had)

 (she's not the brightest nor the wisest tool in the shed)

[QuizzyQuin] (Not the sharpest crayon in the tool box?)

[Emn1ty] (so, you said time for rp?)

[BBR] (Eh, I'll let a master armor smith adjust your armor later)

[Emn1ty] (ok)

[Euanthe] just do Naboo_

* Euanthe finishes her potion off and begins to attempt to remove her very tight armor.

[_Naboo] "Euanthe, I couldn't help but notice the vial you drank, what was it?"

[Euanthe] "Um, a potion. Why?"

[_Naboo] "Eh, I've always been a curious person, I can't help but ask."

[Euanthe] "Well I'm not exactly sure what it does. It tastes pretty bad but it's supposed to help me or something with this quest."

Jun 27 18:26:55 ---	Emn1ty is now known as Eueanthe
Jun 27 18:26:57 <Pocketknife>	set a watch?

Jun 27 18:28:22 <Eueanthe>	BlackRobeRising, do we have tents or anything like that?
Jun 27 18:28:34 <BlackRobeRising>	I didn't double check your equipment lists.
Jun 27 18:28:47 <BlackRobeRising>	Did you remember to bring something to sleep on?
Jun 27 18:28:50 <BlackRobeRising>	And in?
Jun 27 18:28:54 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	all I have is rations...and in theory, they have to be down at the beach.
Jun 27 18:29:04 <BlackRobeRising>	If not, assume you brought something very basic :)
Jun 27 18:29:10 <BlackRobeRising>	And left the rest on the ship.
Jun 27 18:29:11 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	as I can't carry shit
Jun 27 18:29:16 <Eueanthe>	hm...
Jun 27 18:29:29 <Eueanthe>	well, I could have carried a small tent or hanging tent
Jun 27 18:30:29 <Eueanthe>	I don't have it in my inventory, but I figure we'd have equipement like that on the ship.
Jun 27 18:30:44 <Kirveis>	I have a pavilion.... back on the ship.
Jun 27 18:30:49 <Eueanthe>	ha
Jun 27 18:30:51 <BlackRobeRising>	Heh.
Jun 27 18:31:07 <BlackRobeRising>	Assume you have something you can hang between some scrub trees to provide cover and some basic bedrolls, etc.
Jun 27 18:31:21 <Eueanthe>	k
Jun 27 18:31:31 <BlackRobeRising>	If you didn't think to bring stuff...I'm fine with assuming basics but nothing unusual :)

Jun 27 18:32:56 <Eueanthe>	ie, two tents one for each of us

Jun 27 18:39:14 <BlackRobeRising>	Naboo, you notice nothing interesting in the slightest during your watch and the rest of the group wakes up just at dawn as the sun slowly rises above the horizon. The scrub trees that surround you are short, lightly leaved and provide no real hindrance to your vision in any given direction. The only real trees are at the very center of the island but you can barely make out a few in the distance in the dim early light.

Jun 27 18:59:42 <Evel>	"It was at least a hundred but I know the Warlord's raiders were returning as I fled about a month ago."
Jun 27 18:59:59 <Confernicus>	"how many would rally should the opportunity present itself?"
Jun 27 19:00:14 <Evel>	"Rally? To fight or to flee?"

Jun 27 19:00:53 <Evel>	"Fighting, few amongst the slaves I knew. Maybe 1 in 10. The newer ones? Perhaps many. I have no way to know. All would flee, if a chance presented."
Jun 27 19:01:14 <Evel>	"It was a raiding party of about 40 men and two small ships."
Jun 27 19:01:20 <Confernicus>	"and if the opportunity offered no escape?"
Jun 27 19:01:32 <Confernicus>	"How often do they leave?"
Jun 27 19:01:34 <Evel>	"1 in 10, maybe."
Jun 27 19:01:35 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	"we should continue to plan it, and if Mercury is good we shall have his advice on the matter."
Jun 27 19:02:05 <Evel>	"I do not know, I only saw the ships as I fled. I used to be a sailor, so I know each needed about a crew of 20."
Jun 27 19:02:26 <Evel>	"They brought me here, mayhap, a couple months before that."

Jun 27 19:42:15 <Evel>	"Free them?"
Jun 27 19:42:17 <Eueanthe>	"Offer them shelter in the city? We need people to rebuild and letting them build themselves a home would be a kind offer."
Jun 27 19:43:04 <Naboo_>	"Slave owners living with former slaves? There'd be chaos."
Jun 27 19:43:12 <Confernicus>	"and how do we keep the former overlords from starting a bloodbath?"
Jun 27 19:43:45 <Confernicus>	"We need to give the slaves reason to support Euanthe in the coming strugle."
Jun 27 19:44:06 <Eueanthe>	"Me, why me?"
Jun 27 19:44:14 <Confernicus>	"At arms if possible, most of one of the two sides well be useless to us in the end."
Jun 27 19:44:30 <Confernicus>	"Euanthe, how do you think war band politics work?"
Jun 27 19:44:48 <Eueanthe>	"Um…"
Jun 27 19:44:54 *	Evel observed quietly, frowning slightly at the idea of keeping the slaves...enslaved.
Jun 27 19:45:01 *	Eueanthe doesn't know.
Jun 27 19:45:21 <Confernicus>	"The strongest sucedes, you must be the strongest."
Jun 27 19:46:06 <Eueanthe>	"Oh… well I don't know…"
Jun 27 19:46:22 <Confernicus>	"I want either the slaves that well fight, or the bandits that well obey, one or the other."
Jun 27 19:46:57 *	Eueanthe thinks about it, "I'd rather the slaves honestly. I can try."
Jun 27 19:47:20 <Kirveis>	(bbs)
Jun 27 19:47:28 <Evel>	(ok)
Jun 27 19:47:37 <Confernicus>	"Euanthe you well have us at your backs, Felix well tend to you, Kirveis well aid you, and I well topple any who would cause problems"
Jun 27 19:49:17 <Naboo_>	"Evel, is there a lot of travel in or out of the city?"
Jun 27 19:49:51 <Confernicus>	"Can we attack while the bulk of the raiders are away?"
Jun 27 19:50:01 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	"we shall abolish slavery, establish the rule of law, and deal with those who can't adapt."
Jun 27 19:50:18 <Evel>	"Daily daytime trips of slavers entering the city, rarely groups of new slaves. It isn't harvest."
Jun 27 19:50:24 *	Evel smiled at Felix.
Jun 27 19:50:34 <Evel>	"As for the raiders, I do not know their schedule so I could not answer."
Jun 27 19:50:48 <Confernicus>	"Boats are easy to watch."
Jun 27 19:51:39 *	Eueanthe goes to pack up the camp.
Jun 27 19:51:52 <Naboo_>	"I could always try and go into the city under the guise of a Nubian slaver and get a look at the inside."
Jun 27 19:51:58 <Confernicus>	"Evel, is their anyway to rally the slaves, so that they well revolt on signal?"
Jun 27 19:52:28 <Confernicus>	"I can promise freedom at the very least for any slave furthering our cause."
Jun 27 19:52:47 <Evel>	"Slaves passed messages and little things, a bit of extra food. Snuck off to hide who liked who. But...that kind of organization would be hard. Days, maybe a week."
Jun 27 19:53:11 <Confernicus>	"We have time."
Jun 27 19:53:49 <Evel>	"Fair enough."
Jun 27 19:53:59 <Confernicus>	"My offer is simple, freedom for the soldier and his family that would further our cause, does anyone object?"
Jun 27 19:54:16 <Evel>	( Fyi, the Divination window is only 7 days. So 'days' after you arrive or a week is probably going to invalidate it.)
Jun 27 19:54:40 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	(I shall cast again on the morrow.)
Jun 27 19:54:58 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	or rather before we go.
Jun 27 19:55:01 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	once the window is up
Jun 27 19:55:11 <Evel>	( Fair 'nough. )
Jun 27 19:55:16 <Confernicus>	(I'm not terribly concenrned with mercury)
Jun 27 19:55:41 <Confernicus>	9I'm confident in the abilities of my associates)

Jun 27 19:56:32 <Evel>	(Anyway, continue...:P)
Jun 27 19:57:15 <Confernicus>	"So we are all in agreement?"
Jun 27 19:57:23 *	Eueanthe nods.
Jun 27 19:57:25 *	Felix_The_Pensiv nods
Jun 27 19:57:43 *	Naboo_ nod "Sounds good."
Jun 27 19:58:42 <Naboo_>	"So, how are we going to enter the city, unnoticed? Or are we even going to enter before we attack?"
Jun 27 19:58:46 <Evel>	( OOC time jump for travel towards the city? )
Jun 27 19:58:53 <Evel>	( Ah. )
Jun 27 19:59:31 <Confernicus>	"The city is ruined, there well be openings."
Jun 27 20:00:15 <Confernicus>	"I'd prefer for the warlord to die silently."
Jun 27 20:01:46 <Confernicus>	"Is anyone else confident with their silence?"
Jun 27 20:02:07 *	Eueanthe "Lets just get going, I'll do my part."
Jun 27 20:02:47 <Confernicus>	"Very well"
Jun 27 20:02:49 <Naboo_>	"Yes, let's not waste more time discussing our actions instead of actually acting."

Jun 27 20:07:27 <Evel>	The group was able to make it within sight of the outermost farms. The nights were uneventful as anything monstrous had long since been dealt with by the Warlord. You came across no patrols, but with an island, no slave could escape far now could they? The crops were mostly wheat and a bit of barely, nothing so tall as to completely obscure your vision. If you approached during the day, you'd be seen by the slaves and guards workin
Jun 27 20:07:27 <Evel>	g in the fields.
Jun 27 20:07:42 <Evel>	( Good way. You made it to the city without being seen by anyone interesting. )
Jun 27 20:08:05 <Evel>	( Well, most of the way. You are still a few hours out )
Jun 27 20:08:41 <Confernicus>	(is there anywhere that would make a good vantage point?)
Jun 27 20:08:55 <Confernicus>	( a hill, an abandoned watch tower etc.)
Jun 27 20:09:15 <Evel>	( It is farmland. )
Jun 27 20:09:42 <Evel>	( It is relatively flat and with few buildings taller than a single story. Best you could do is a damaged grain mill or the like. But that isn't really built for you to climb. )
Jun 27 20:10:25 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	"if you pick out places you would like to look, I can remote view them."

Jun 27 20:12:22 <Confernicus>	ok, see if you can see inside the city
Jun 27 20:12:40 <Confernicus>	"i'd like to know what they act like"
Jun 27 20:13:13 <Evel>	(You are hours of walking from the city. 400'+40'/lvl isn't going to get you anything. )
Jun 27 20:13:29 <Evel>	( For the city. )
Jun 27 20:13:38 <Evel>	( It would get you a good view of the farm outside the city tho. )
Jun 27 20:14:19 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	lets do that.

Jun 27 20:15:37 <Evel>	( Clear. )

The guards were mostly guarding the slaves but the one on Watch noticed your party and advanced on you rapidly with a spear in hand. He clearly was not expecting you.

Jun 27 20:50:13 <Evel>	( Maybeh )
Jun 27 20:50:52 <Evel>	The guard shrugged, "What special detail? The Warlord normally tells us 'bout the slave hunters so we don't think they are the armed slaves in the forest coming to attack us. 'voids problems."

Jun 27 20:53:09 <Evel>	( Abandoned grain silos and such. Not really a pain, just checking abandoned buildings...)

Jun 27 20:56:39 *	Confernicus blows chunks all over the ground, grabing felixes should to steady himself
Jun 27 20:56:58 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	"and this idiot was drinking during the hunt."
Jun 27 20:56:59 *	Evel frowned slightly and backed away from the group as Confernicus vomits. Bits got on the guard's shoes.
Jun 27 20:57:08 <Evel>	"Just get the fuck out of here before you ruin some of the crops."
Jun 27 20:57:28 <Evel>	The guard moved off, clearly wanting to get away from the likely sick fellow.
Jun 27 20:57:54 *	Confernicus continues clutching felixes shoulder
Jun 27 20:59:16 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	"we should head home."
Jun 27 20:59:23 <Evel>	"Just go."
Jun 27 20:59:35 *	Naboo_ whispers to Felix "I don't know what you said or why he's vomiting, but good job."
Jun 27 20:59:35 *	Evel the guard moved off but kept a distant eye on them.
Jun 27 20:59:51 *	Kirveis waits until the guard is well away, then whispers, "Was that really necessary?"
Jun 27 21:00:19 <Confernicus>	"It worked didn't it"
Jun 27 21:01:24 <Naboo_>	"There are no bounds to the extent someone will go to put on a good act."
Jun 27 21:02:12 <Evel>	( When would you guys like to call it a night tonight? 10pm PST? 11?)
Jun 27 21:02:52 <Kirveis>	(No limits for me.)
Jun 27 21:03:18 <Evel>	Once you move past the farm, you encounter a few others but they look either abandoned or there were no guard that noticed you. Likely the former.
Jun 27 21:04:00 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	(i am good for a while 3am is when I have to call it as a hard limit)
Jun 27 21:04:21 <Evel>	(3am EST?)
Jun 27 21:04:36 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	(yea, like last time, I just have to call it then.)
Jun 27 21:04:48 <Evel>	( Fair 'nough )
Jun 27 21:05:03 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	(but obviously we don't need to go that late)
Jun 27 21:05:39 <Evel>	( Latest I'll go is 10:30-11 tonight, I need to be up early. )
Jun 27 21:06:00 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	(kk)
Jun 27 21:06:09 <Evel>	( That would be at the latest 2 your time )
Jun 27 21:06:33 <Evel>	( Anyway, let me know how far you guys plan to go tonight? Sneak into the city? You have time. )
Jun 27 21:07:03 <Confernicus>	(Can we walk in the front gate?)
Jun 27 21:07:06 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	sneak in and recon. perhaps find a temporary base?
Jun 27 21:07:17 <Kirveis>	"Once daylight comes, hiding isn't going to be a particularly good option."
Jun 27 21:07:29 <Evel>	( You don't know where it is...but I suppose if you found a gate you could use it. )
Jun 27 21:07:38 <Evel>	( Wouldn't take more than 30min or so once you reach the wall to find one )
Jun 27 21:07:50 <Evel>	( And you'll have at least 4 hours of night left by then. )
Jun 27 21:13:43 <Kirveis>	(So...)
Jun 27 21:13:50 <Evel>	( Do I need to roll a random encounter? :D )
Jun 27 21:13:54 <Kirveis>	(Let's go find the wall then?)
Jun 27 21:15:29 *	Felix_The_Pensiv agrees
Jun 27 21:16:21 <Evel>	The party arrived at the wall a bit after midnight without incident. The structure was a ruin, more rubble than anything else in most places, but impressive rubble. Maybe 15' high rubble.
Jun 27 21:16:22 <Naboo_>	(I'm wondering how an encounter would go, since I've never done an all text campaign before.)
Jun 27 21:16:49 <Evel>	( Mostly the same as normal. Obviously, precise positioning gets handwaved. )
Jun 27 21:17:02 <Naboo_>	(Cool.)
Jun 27 21:17:42 <Evel>	( e.g. You are being attacked by four spiders. One is crawling on the roof the cavern while three move in from behind. [If you cast an aoe, I'd probably let you catch at least 50% of a 4-man group, more if it is a big one])
Jun 27 21:18:14 <Evel>	( Obviously, don't throw an AoE at anything engaged in melee with someone friendly. )
Jun 27 21:19:02 <Kirveis>	(Unless the aoe is a positive energy channel and you're fighting undead.)
Jun 27 21:19:29 <Evel>	(Well, ya. )
Jun 27 21:20:55 *	Kirveis could easily scale over the wall, but not quietly, so finding a gate would be for the best... so long as we can bluff our way past guards.
Jun 27 21:21:02 <Evel>	( Complicated battles I'd probably come up with a map for but I doubt we'll encounter mass combat anytime soon )
Jun 27 21:22:49 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	a gate would be best.
Jun 27 21:23:12 <Evel>	( Gate is unless someone objects quickly. )
Jun 27 21:23:22 <Kirveis>	(Not going to fight a couple dozen soldiers at once?)
Jun 27 21:23:53 <Evel>	( You won't know until you bluff check )
Jun 27 21:25:48 <Naboo_>	(I'll use Tongues if you want me too.)
Jun 27 21:26:01 <Confernicus>	(Shit theirs a seirious thunder storm heading inland right at me, if i go off line i'll probably be out all night
Jun 27 21:26:17 <Confernicus>	(I trust importent decisions and rolls to Emn1ty)
Jun 27 21:26:18 <Evel>	( Alright, if you go offline we'll just end session I suppose. )
Jun 27 21:27:06 <Confernicus>	(It's fucking gorgeous though)
Jun 27 21:27:15 <Confernicus>	(anyway just a heads up)
Jun 27 21:28:28 <Evel>	( I bet )
Jun 27 21:28:38 <Evel>	( So I'm guessing gate or are you objecting, Kirveis? )
Jun 27 21:31:39 <Evel>	(I'm taking the silence as a not objecting then...)
Jun 27 21:31:53 <Kirveis>	(I'm all in favour of the gate, I thought I said so.)
Jun 27 21:32:01 <Evel>	( I wasn't sure 'bout the fight bit)
Jun 27 21:33:51 <Evel>	The party moved northward until they found a gate, well, where a gate would go at any rate. It was a large hole in the wall with a serious of barricades to stop a rider or wagon from moving freely through the space. There were only four guards in the flickering torchlight. One of them waved to them and said, "Patrol returning this late? Who are you, what is your business?"

Jun 27 21:34:52 <Evel>	( No. But presumably the one that hailed you, is. )
Jun 27 21:35:14 <Confernicus>	I'll start studing him, while still pretending to be sick

Jun 27 21:36:31 *	Kirveis will stay quiet and let Felix do the talking again. At least I can understand everything said.
Jun 27 21:36:32 <Evel>	( You still need to talk tho :P )
Jun 27 21:37:11 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	We are just trying to get home for the night, we were out hunting but our friend here got sick, and we had to bring him back home and fetch a healer.

Jun 27 21:39:06 <Emn1ty_mobile>	(sick?)
Jun 27 21:39:11 <Evel>	The guards cleared a wide berth, not desiring to get sick themselves.

Jun 27 21:40:53 <Evel>	( :P I reward creative solutions. )
Jun 27 21:40:58 <Confernicus>	(We go in)
Jun 27 21:41:35 <Evel>	( Aye. )
Jun 27 21:41:53 <Kirveis>	(And quickly, before they realize we didn't show proper paperwork or give him the secret fistbump.)
Jun 27 21:42:18 <Naboo_>	(I wish I had a secret fistbump.)
Jun 27 21:42:33 <Evel>	( Aye. Any particular direction to go in? )
Jun 27 21:43:45 <Evel>	The party passed the gate without further attention. There were burned out structures, little more than rocks and burnt timber in every direction. Evel had said the grain and the related slaves were at the city center. The bay with the ships was the furthest from this gate, more or less.
Jun 27 21:43:57 <Emn1ty_mobile>	(in n out has a horribly long drive through line T_T)
Jun 27 21:44:02 <Evel>	( Yes. )

Jun 27 21:44:43 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	(we don't have those :( 
Jun 27 21:44:56 <Kirveis>	(You call that 'good food'?)
Jun 27 21:45:38 <Emn1ty_mobile>	(relatively yes)
Jun 27 21:45:56 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	(at this hour, that about the best you will get.)
Jun 27 21:46:04 <Evel>	( Fast food wise? Yes )
Jun 27 21:46:23 *	Kirveis assumes that the warlord will be in a building in good condition, so we can ignore the ruins and head for either the city centre or the bay...
Jun 27 21:46:25 <Evel>	( Eh, show up at 10:30-11:15am and you get it fine )
Jun 27 21:46:49 <Evel>	( Just remember its night so vision is kinda  a problem as far as seeing more than 100' )
Jun 27 21:47:00 <Confernicus>	(Not a fan of In n' out)

Jun 27 21:48:19 <Kirveis>	"So... head to the slaves and try to start a revolt, or look for the warlord and cut off his head?"
Jun 27 21:48:54 <Evel>	( Lucky you :P I can't find anything but in-n-n-out after 9:30 )
Jun 27 21:49:06 <Evel>	( Maybe El Pollo Loco is open until 10. )
Jun 27 21:49:12 <Kirveis>	(Montage is absolutely delicious cajun food and open really late. And Voodoo is of course open 23.5/365.)
Jun 27 21:49:20 <Naboo_>	(Ya, if you want food poisoning from a taco)
Jun 27 21:49:27 <Evel>	(Do remember you've burned most of the night now, you are down to 2-3 hours left )
Jun 27 21:50:03 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	(nah, I get delicious street tacos all the time.)
Jun 27 21:50:17 <Evel>	( Montage isn't chain fast food everyone can get easy :P )

Jun 27 21:53:04 <Confernicus>	(Kirveis as do I, but i never remember to bring everything when i travel)
Jun 27 21:53:08 <Evel>	( Yes but you lose your power supply at high enough voltages. )
Jun 27 21:53:16 <Evel>	( LIke a lighting strike )
Jun 27 21:53:23 <Kirveis>	"The boy fled the city. If there was anywhere he could hide here, why would he have left?"
Jun 27 21:53:51 <Confernicus>	"Hide and lay low arn't the same"
Jun 27 21:54:23 <Evel>	"Hmmmm, anywhere near the wall far from the gates. might be suitable. There are a few buildings that have something resembling a structure left that go unused. There are a daily patrols within the city walls to check for slaves trying to climb over in either direction tho."
Jun 27 21:54:57 <Confernicus>	How are most of the bandits sleeping?
Jun 27 21:55:40 <Evel>	"I told you before I don't know where they sleep. I assume indoors somewhere."
Jun 27 21:55:49 <Confernicus>	(yeah this'll be dead faster then an hour)
Jun 27 21:56:06 <Evel>	( That's fine. Once you find a place to lie low it is a good spot to end anyway. )
Jun 27 21:56:10 <Confernicus>	no quotations
Jun 27 21:56:23 <Confernicus>	i'm looking arround the street for signs of where they are sleeping
Jun 27 21:56:29 <Evel>	( Oh. )
Jun 27 21:56:35 <Evel>	( Ummm, night remember? )
Jun 27 21:56:53 <Evel>	( You aren't anywhere near where they'd be sleeping and your vision radius is ~100' effectively )
Jun 27 21:56:57 <Confernicus>	There's moonlight which is enough to see large buildings
Jun 27 21:57:05 <Confernicus>	anything with candle light in the window
Jun 27 21:57:07 <Evel>	( And I already told you there aren't any near the gate. )
Jun 27 21:57:13 <Evel>	( Its rubble. )
Jun 27 21:57:47 <Evel>	(Logically, if the only places the guards operate are the slaves in the city center and the bay...it would be somewhere around there. )
Jun 27 21:57:52 <Confernicus>	I'm assuming i'm not standing right at the other side of the gate but moving into the city it self
Jun 27 21:58:13 <Evel>	( In which direction? Towards the center? The bay? Moving along the wall? )
Jun 27 21:58:23 <Confernicus>	likely towards the center

Jun 27 22:02:13 <Naboo_>	(I wasn't looking when you were asking for a half-elf)
Jun 27 22:03:25 <Confernicus>	you are a half elf right?
Jun 27 22:03:32 <Evel>	The group moved towards the city center and were lucky enough to avoid the night patrol on their way to it. The closer they got to the center, the less damaged the city became. Eventually, a few structures with torches could be seen in the distance surrounded by a handful of other, less intact structure. A large watchtower dominated the city center, presumably to watch for fires and the like inside the city walls.
Jun 27 22:03:32 <Naboo_>	(Yup)
Jun 27 22:03:59 <Confernicus>	(so you have twice the vision radius of anyone here

Jun 27 22:04:30 <Confernicus>	"Ok, these guys are really well organized for a bunch of raiders."
Jun 27 22:05:01 <Evel>	( You can't hold onto slaves and keep monsters at bay by being stupid. )
Jun 27 22:06:07 <Confernicus>	(But typically you don't run night patrols checking other raiders)
Jun 27 22:06:30 <Evel>	( They aren't checking for other raiders. They are checking for escaped slaves. )
Jun 27 22:06:36 <Evel>	( Well, slaves attempting to escape. )
Jun 27 22:08:23 <Evel>	( He has between 100-200 soldiers. Assuming 200 slaves and a 1:5 ratio, only 40 soldiers are serving as slave overseers. Assuming its 150, that leaves plenty for a few night patrols and guards. )
Jun 27 22:08:56 <Evel>	( Anyway, I believe you want to cast remote viewing or the like? )
Jun 27 22:09:13 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	.r 1d20+4
Jun 27 22:09:14 <dice-bot>	Felix_The_Pensiv : 1d20+4 = 9 | [5] | 5+4 | 
Jun 27 22:09:27 <Confernicus>	(But you also have the problem of pulling from an unprofesional, generally unskilled force, which means at any given moment alot of your guys our shirking work or getting drunk)
Jun 27 22:09:35 <Confernicus>	(anyway it's not importent)
Jun 27 22:09:44 <Evel>	( I never said they were unprofessional or unskilled. )
Jun 27 22:09:47 <Evel>	( You infered that. )
Jun 27 22:10:25 <Evel>	( I previously referred to them as 'a company or two' of soldiers in the previous session >.>)
Jun 27 22:10:35 <Evel>	(Perception, Felix for the remote viewing? )
Jun 27 22:10:51 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	i did. its a 9 :(
Jun 27 22:10:52 <Evel>	(Any particular target or just trying to get a better view?)
Jun 27 22:10:59 <Confernicus>	(If they were profesional, they'd get the wall fixed)
Jun 27 22:11:02 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	better view
Jun 27 22:11:28 <Evel>	( You are assuming that the problems in the surrounding area would come at them by ground on foot and equipped to siege. )
Jun 27 22:12:03 <Confernicus>	(no just that an intact wall makes for better management of personel, especially when slaves are involved
Jun 27 22:12:12 <Confernicus>	(rubble provides too much cover)
Jun 27 22:12:54 *	Kirveis can see twice as far also, btw, but isn't offering that information to the others.
Jun 27 22:13:21 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	.r 1d20+4
Jun 27 22:13:21 <dice-bot>	Felix_The_Pensiv : 1d20+4 = 23 | [19] | 19+4 | 
Jun 27 22:14:36 <Evel>	( Yes. But you'd have to have the resources to rebuild miles of wall... and they seem to need the slaves to y'know, farm food )
Jun 27 22:15:58 <Confernicus>	(profesional soldiers are EXPENSIVE, very much so if you can afford 200 of them and you already have slaves, a wall repairs are pretty cheap
Jun 27 22:16:33 <Evel>	(Assuming a market for Nubian soldiers)
Jun 27 22:17:14 <Evel>	( Building a wall like that takes a decade )
Jun 27 22:17:24 <Kirveis>	"Dawn will be upon us soon, what's our decision?"
Jun 27 22:17:36 <Confernicus>	(In the feudal system soldiers are always at a premium, too many wars for them not to be.)
Jun 27 22:17:45 <Evel>	( ...this isn't medieval europe )
Jun 27 22:17:53 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	"I found buildings without people."
Jun 27 22:18:10 <Confernicus>	(even in the greek systems war were omnipresent)
Jun 27 22:18:13 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	we should hide out the day.
Jun 27 22:18:40 <Evel>	( These aren't greeks either. )
Jun 27 22:18:43 <Confernicus>	(anyway as i said earlier it doesn't really matter, I don't think now is the time to argue about this.)
Jun 27 22:18:51 <Naboo_>	"I doubt any patrol will be checking buildings, right?"
Jun 27 22:19:26 *	Evel shrugged at that.
Jun 27 22:19:33 <Evel>	"I know not, I left under the cover of darkness."
Jun 27 22:19:43 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	.r 1d20+4
Jun 27 22:19:43 <dice-bot>	Felix_The_Pensiv : 1d20+4 = 9 | [5] | 5+4 | 
Jun 27 22:20:08 <Naboo_>	"Let's try to keep our disguises intact then."
Jun 27 22:20:16 <Kirveis>	"Well then, let's pick a building, hole up inside, and decide a rotation for keeping watch until dusk."
Jun 27 22:21:32 <Naboo_>	(Anyone want to go first?)
Jun 27 22:21:43 <Confernicus>	(I can go first)
Jun 27 22:22:01 -->	You are now talking on ##Colonists
Jun 27 22:22:01 ---	Topic for ##Colonists is 6pm PST / 9pm EST Thursdays | Campaign Info: https://github.com/BlackRobeRising/colonists-player-notes
Jun 27 22:22:01 ---	Topic for ##Colonists set by BlackRobeRising!~darkness@cpe-108-185-169-41.socal.res.rr.com at Thu Jun 13 22:27:29 2013
Jun 27 22:22:03 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	You find several, a couple in each direction. They are sound but their roofs were destroyed by what looks like a fire. However, they are a couple stories and mostly made from clay bricks so you should have plenty of cover from above on the first floor. Or you can hide on the second and hope nothing flies.
Jun 27 22:22:05 <Kirveis>	(No, there might be spiders in there.)
Jun 27 22:22:13 *	Euanthe takes second and we lost our gm...
Jun 27 22:22:31 <Confernicus>	(My battery is going to be dead in just a moment
Jun 27 22:23:02 <Confernicus>	(So i'm out for the rest of the night, see you guys next week :)  )
Jun 27 22:23:09 <Euanthe>	(gnight)
Jun 27 22:23:16 <Naboo_>	(We'll finish here then, basically how we ended last time.)
Jun 27 22:23:30 <Evel>	( Night space )
Jun 27 22:23:59 <Kirveis>	And next Thursday we spend the whole session slaughtering Nubians?)
Jun 27 22:24:01 <Felix_The_Pensiv>	meditate, then 2nd watch. for me
Jun 27 22:24:04 <Evel>	( Yes. )
Jun 27 22:24:40 <Euanthe>	(third watch again then)
Jun 27 22:24:49 <Naboo_>	(last, last, last.)
Jun 27 22:25:14 <Evel>	( alright, saving the logs to github again? )
Jun 27 22:25:36 <Euanthe>	(fine with me)
Jun 27 22:25:53 *	Kirveis hasn't been casting any notable spells, so she doesn't need to sleep more than necessary, and can keep watch. Bephnora wants her beauty sleep though, so she's not staying up.
Jun 27 22:28:20 <Evel>	(Okay, copying pasting from this point up then. Goodnight folks)

 BlackRobeRising has changed the topic to: 6pm PST / 9pm EST Thursdays | Campaign Info: https://github.com/BlackRobeRising/colonists-player-notes | Anyone who misses two sessions in a row w/o notice gets booted.
<BlackRobeRising> Ready to start folks?
<Emn1ty> sure
<Felix_The_Pensiv> yes
<BlackRobeRising> The watches were mostly uneventful, however the majority of the party [including the NPC Evel] has seemed to have contracted some sort of sickness. Perhaps it was from the local water [Montezuma's Revenge!] and was in no shape for combat. It was most unfortunate...
--- Emn1ty is now known as Euanthe
<BlackRobeRising> (Works? :) )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> well, other than the fact I can probably cure it somehow...
<BlackRobeRising> After Felix's best attempts to heal the rest of the party, the pathogen seems immune to magic.
 ( :P )
<Euanthe> (lol)
<BlackRobeRising> In fact, 'the shits' seem to have gotten worse from the attempt.
<Euanthe> ( o.o )
* Euanthe avoids them.
<BlackRobeRising> ( Magic-immune diarrhea that replicates faster if it encounters magic! )
<Euanthe> ( good god you are evil )
<BlackRobeRising> ( Well, I had to come up with something and the week without bathrooms at work has left my mind in one place :/ )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (clearly we need samples)
<BlackRobeRising> ( Or y'know, hide them as best you can and go end the threat before they get discovered. :P )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> ugh. brb, phone call
<Euanthe> ( T-T )
--- Trystia is now known as Kirveis
* Kirveis hasn't been drinking the local water. She's in fact just been eating the local runaways whenever Evel wasn't looking. <_<
<BlackRobeRising> ( -applauds- )
<Kirveis> (So are we basically just doing a mulligan and waiting for next week? Or actually going to have a session where everyone gets sick?)
<BlackRobeRising> ( The only people sick are Evel and the afkers )
 (Aka the people not here)
 ( It is my excuse for them dropping out from the 'task' )
<Kirveis> (Well, it beats them getting caught by the guards, and makes more sense than splitting up Scooby-Doo style.)
<BlackRobeRising> (I'm glad you approve...now we just need Felix to get back and if you two want to start planning go ahead? xD )
<Euanthe> (Don't really remember the specifics of where we left off)
<BlackRobeRising> (You were camped out near the center of the ruined city in an abandoned house a couple blocks from where all the slaves/grain/Warlord/guards are.)
<Kirveis> "Okay, so we can't just keep waiting for you lot to feel better, so we're going to have to leave you behind. Keep an eye on Evel, keep your heads down, and um, how is it put... 'Keep your scales clean' just doesn't translate right."

--- You are now known as Evel
<Evel> "Good luck, I'm sorry this happened..."
<Kirveis> "Why are you sorry? Were you contaminating their water?"
<Evel> "No, but it is kind of embarrassing to watch 3 people take on the job while you shit yourself."
* Euanthe smirks.
<Kirveis> "We're in the middle of the city and so far as we know haven't been detected by the guards yet. You did your job, so don't worry."
--> QuizzyQuin (6bc0d00c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.107.192.208.12) has joined ##Colonists
<QuizzyQuin> (Am I late??)
 Oh
<Kirveis> (Very!)
<Euanthe> (^)
<Evel> (You have the shits, Quizzy. Congratulations :P)
<QuizzyQuin> BlackRobe isn't here either though...
<Evel> (Forgotten the NPCs name already :/ Sadness. )
<QuizzyQuin> (Oh, I'm dumb.
 (i KNEW THAT.)
 (It looks like we're missing some people though)
<Evel> ( Yes. We gave up waiting and decided to start. Then Felix got a phone call :| )
<QuizzyQuin> (Also, were we going to play last Thursday? It was the 4th...)
<Evel> ( We skipped the 4th. I just changed the topic 'bout skipping it tonight. )
<QuizzyQuin> (Aweosme.)
* Evel shrugged at that and went to the corner to do his business.
<Euanthe> "So… what are we gonna do without the others?" she asks Kirveis.
<Felix_The_Pensiv> back
 sorry
<Evel> ( Anyway, Quizzy, since you are here you can 'get better' and play :P )
<Kirveis> "Whatever it takes. With any luck, killing their leader will demoralize the soldiers, and we won't have to fight them all. We'll just have to be extra careful."
<Euanthe> "True… I think we may be able to manage. I'll do my best at the least" she says, noding her head.
--- QuizzyQuin is now known as Naboo_
<Naboo_> "Killing the Warlord of a small Island? I'm sure it won't be too difficult."
<Euanthe> "Like anyone well protected, they aren't expecting things to go wrong."
<Naboo_> (Are we still disguised?)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (I assume so)
<Evel> ( More or less, yes. its probably not as perfect as it was after sleeping in them. )
<Naboo_> (Well there be a score difference? It was a 20+15)
<Evel> ( Yes. If you want to re-roll, feel free. But I'd say -5 :P )
<Naboo_> (Awesome, 20+10)
<Evel> (Aye. So plan and execute? ;) )
<Euanthe> ( well the simplest thing is to just wait for him to be alone… if that's even possible )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (we need more info about his routine, surroundings, etc
<Euanthe> ( regardless, Euanthe is fine with any strategy short of head on assault )
<Evel> ( Well plan IC, you don't know his routine and such w/o more ressearch :/ )
 ( It is pretty safe to assume he is alone at night [sleeping] with minimal guards )
* Euanthe comes up with the first solution on her mind, "We may as well slay him when he is alone, and vulnerable. Or perhaps subdue him? But, whatever it is it must be finished in front of his men so they can see him fall."
<Kirveis> (These are all stone buildings, right?)
<Evel> ( Correct. )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> I have merge with stone.
 we could walk through walls after a fashion I believe
 provided they are not too thick
<Kirveis> "If we can determine where he's sleeping, I can simply reshape the stone in his walls so that we can slip inside and slit his throat."
<Evel> ( door, sec )
<Euanthe> "Shall we gather that information then, and quietly so?"
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "How goes the plans for the slave revolt?"
<Evel> ( back )
 ( You haven't encountered any slaves by Evel to plot a revolt w/ )
<Euanthe> ( yeah, Kirveis ate them all <.< )
<Kirveis> *burp*
<Euanthe> ( lol )
<Evel> ( :P I meant you didn't go look for any yetr :P )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (Then we need to look for some, and possibly arm them)
 (home made spears, etc)
<Evel> ( Well, where will you get the spears from? Slaves are under guard/overseers )
<Euanthe> ( we should just figure out where he's vulnerable to attack first )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (trees and some whittling time?)
<Kirveis> (Kill the guards, take their spears, give to slaves.)
<Evel> ( Well decide ;) )
<Naboo_> "I don't believe we have any information on slaves. Evel, from where we are do you know where they might sleep?"
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (sneak attack is our only option, either that or long term guerrilla warfare)
<Evel> "They are in the buildings in the center of town. I'm not sure which ones have the guards and which the slaves. We moved around some."
<Kirveis> (I'm all in favour of finding the warlord, sneaking in while he sleeps, and killing him.)
<Naboo_> (Same)
<Kirveis> (We can deal with the slaves after the change in power.)
<Euanthe> (same here)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (ok)
<Euanthe> ( *monty python intermission* )
<Naboo_> "Well, we should find info on the warlord's daily routines first, if you don't mind me saying Evel, the slaves can wait."
* Evel shrugged slightly.
<Evel> "Whatever you think is best."
<Naboo_> (What's the IC time?)
<Evel> ( Whenever you planned to wake up after travelling all night...I'd assume afternoon. )
<Naboo_> (Probably)
* Naboo_ begins to softly whistle a sailor song (http://www.chickenonaraft.com/)
<Naboo_> (For rp's sake)
<Evel> ( Okay ;) )
* Kirveis spends a little while studying her spellbook, as she hadn't actually memorized the spell she was offering to cast, and then gets ready to head out. "We shouldn't wait until dark this time, or he'll already be inside and asleep with no chance for us to guess where."
 Euanthe takes her potion, now positive it wasn't what was making her grow since she hadn'y grown for several days.
<Euanthe> hadn't*
<Naboo_> "Evel, any idea where the warlord might be or sleep?"
<Evel> "I never interacted with him, but I'd assume in the tower in the center of the inhabited buildings is where he lives. I know no slaves ever seem to go into it, at any rate."
<Naboo_> "Is it well guarded?"
* Euanthe nods, "Sounds like a good place to start."
<Evel> "Sort of. I know there are always a few guards around it but I do not know if there are alot inside. Its generally 3 guards at the entrance."
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "are there any other ways in?"
<Kirveis> "We'll make another way in."
<Naboo_> (Kirveis, you spoke Nubian right?)
<Evel> "I only know of the main entrance."
<Kirveis> (Yes, I can speak Nubian.)
* Euanthe gets her stuff ready, "Why don't we go see this tower with our own eyes?"
<Kirveis> (There's 11 languages total which I can speak, in fact.)
<Naboo_> (That is very useful.)
 "I have a partial idea, can someone create a magical widfire of sorts?"
 (Anyone cast fire spells?)
<Euanthe> ( i'm getting a planet of the apes vibe from this for some reason )
* Euanthe shakes her head.
<Naboo_> (If you think about it, that could be horribly racist. But I think I get what you mean.)
* Kirveis hesitantly volunteers that she knows a couple of spells capable of conjuring fire.
<Naboo_> "If there's only one way in and out, why not force him out at night?"
<Euanthe> ( I was thinking of the second movie )
<Naboo_> (Or that.)
<Euanthe> ( I am too young to make planet of the apes references )
<Kirveis> "Because the city is in a bad enough shape already without setting it on fire as well? We're trying to take over, not salt the earth."
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "I say we go with the make an entrance idea"
* Euanthe "So long as we get in there unnoticed I'm fine. Silencing guards or avoiding them are both valid options."
<Felix_The_Pensiv> .roll 1d20+4
<dice-bot> Felix_The_Pensiv : 1d20+4 = 16 | [12] | 12+4 | 
<Felix_The_Pensiv> engineering check, for a good place to make our door
<Evel> ( Felix: The base of the Tower, based on your quick look last night, seemed to be stable with relatively thick stone and mortar walls. Any point on the first level could be penetrated but it would take significant investment to punch a human-sized hole. It also would likely not go unnoticed as the sound of stone against stone is hardly silent. )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (not if someone can do it magically)
<Kirveis> (I've actually got a much better engineering modifier...)
<Evel> ( Just pointing out the issues. Yes, a silence spell would stop that from being an issue. )
<Kirveis> (Maybe that could just be to assist?)
<Evel> ( Roll and I'll tell you what you know, Kirveis )
<Kirveis> (Anywho, my thought was to aim a bit high and use the stone I was removing to create a ramp leading up.)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> stone shape does 16 cu ft of stone in a go
<Evel> ( A plan/method would help more )
<Kirveis> (17 cubic feet.)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> err, yes
<Evel> ( So stone shape to enter the second floor in one casting ? )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> how many casts to make a tunnel?
<Evel> ( Depends on how far away from the base of the tower you want the entrance to be. )
 ( If you are right outside, one casting. )
<Kirveis> (Well, one casting should be enough if the wall isn't too thick.)
<Evel> ( You'd have to crawl through one at a time tho. )
<Kirveis> .roll 1d20+10 Engineering
<dice-bot> Kirveis : 1d20+10 Engineering = 21 | [11] | 11+10 Engineering | 
<Euanthe> ( oh great, tight places )
<Evel> ( What plan are you asking 'bout Kirveis? )
<Kirveis> With a +2 from Felix, that's 23 to guess how thick the wall is and where best to go through.
<Euanthe> (god, every time I hear the name felix I get a little jumpy, cause in another campaign he was an antagonist that killed my character's parents XD )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (I just looked up roman names.)
<Evel> ( Okay. The walls are probably ~4' thick. Best place isn't really the case as the construction is pretty uniform around the outer wall. The higher up you go, the thinner the wall gets but not fast enough to significantly enough to make up the distance [8'] b/t floors )
<Naboo_> (Sorry, I've been gone; I have another person using my computer.)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "Shall we make our tunnel?"
<Evel> ( its kay )
* Kirveis fetches out her journal and starts sketching her idea and crunching the numbers, "Hmm... if we go in at the ground level, the best I can do is a circular hole about 28 inches across."
 Kirveis looks meaningfully at Euanthe, "I'm not sure all of us could fit through."
 Euanthe fidgets a bit, "Yeah yeah..."
<Naboo_> "That doesn't mean you can't help though. Would you be fine with guarding the area after we go in?"
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "we could perhaps camoflage our hole and wait the night?
 then enlarge and attack?
<Euanthe> "I'm fine with guarding it."
<Naboo_> (Quick ranodm question, Can you use a Disguise check to camoflauge an area?"
<Euanthe> (I think camoflage falls under survival actually)
<Naboo_> (Damn.)
<Evel> ( I think Euanthe is correct but I'd let you do it. )
* Kirveis thinks for a minute. "Once we're inside, the worst that could happen is that they throw up the alarm and every guard in the city shows up, right?"
<Naboo_> (Damn.+63)
 (Woops, accidently hit keyboard)
<Kirveis> "What if two of us went inside, created a distraction, and the other two then hit the guards from behind when they came in to check? Then we'd all be inside, the guards would be dead, and we could go upstairs and kill the warlord."
<Euanthe> "We don't know if you can make it to the door unnoticed though."
 (sorry, you said distraction :P
 )
<Naboo_> "Are you sure no one would become suspicious of what happened to the people that guarded an important building?"
<Evel> ( Any reason you can't cast the spell twice? And do realize I said it was an estimate based on a quick survey at the dead of night...)
<Euanthe> ( what kind of cast is Kirveis again? )
 caster*
<Kirveis> (I'm a wizard, Harry!)
<Euanthe> ( thus, unless she prepared two of them she cannot cast it again )
<Kirveis> (I can only cast one Stone Shape per day at most.)
 (My other level 4 slot has to be Conjuration.)
<Evel> ( Does anyone have silence? xD )
<Kirveis> (Just Forced Quiet, the level 1 version.)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> yes
 I do have silence
 2nd level spell
 woot
 "I shall silence the area, If you do it, try and make a tiny keyhole to peep through. I will be able to remote view the interior."
<Evel> ( Just silence it and break the wall down with a log or something? :P )
<Kirveis> "By area, you mean where the guards are?"
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (If we can do that I suppose, its all the same)
 (We will most likely have to tear down most buildings and use it as building materials for intact structures.
<Evel> ( It will take longer than stone shape but as long as you aren't discovered...:P )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (we can thin out the wall with stone shape)
<Evel> ( also true )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (shall we make it so?)
<Kirveis> (Well, there's only one of us who can't get in through the hole I can make...
 (Which would be much wider if the wall were only 2-3 feet deep.)
<Evel> ( Yep. )
<Naboo_> (The holes going to be two feet in diameter right?
<Kirveis> (28 inches.)
<Evel> ( If it is 4'. If it is 3', its about 25% bigger. Etc. )
<Euanthe> (squeezing rules)
<Naboo_> (woops, I read that as one person who can get in
<Felix_The_Pensiv> wait, I can gaseous form the fatty.
 :)
* Euanthe glares.
<Naboo_> (lul)
* Euanthe walks over, and dings Felix_The_Pensiv on the head.
<Evel> ( xD Children, children :P )
<Euanthe> (it's not hard either at 6'5)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> sounds like a plan? alternatively we can send one person directly to the top with it
 and in windows, under door cracks, etc.
<Kirveis> (If the wall were 3' thick, the hole would be 32" in diameter.)
<Naboo_> (Depending how long it lasts, I'm sure there are some cracks where the sleeping room reside)
 (In relation to gaseous form)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> 14min for it to wear off.
<Kirveis> "Maybe we should have one person go to the top with a rope, send down a rope, and we could all climb up top and then I could punch in through the roof with a huge hole?"
<Euanthe> "Assuming the roof is stone and not wood."
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "this is a reasonable Idea. who has rope?"
<Evel> (The roof of the tower is stone. )
<Naboo_> "This is also assuming the person we are looking for is up there and jumping through this hole wouldn't break our collective legs."
<Euanthe> (we don't know that XD )
<Evel> ( It would be logical and I'll give it to you with your engineering rolls ;) )
<Kirveis> "I can turn the stone into steps."
<Naboo_> (We could probably see it made of stone when we see it outside anyway.)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "we could also collapse the whole structure?"
<Kirveis> "It's not like I can actually disintegrate the stone, it has to go somewhere, so I'll make steps you can go down."
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "this is historically bad for occupants."
<Kirveis> "What?! Collapse it? It's in better shape than anything else in town! We need a place like that to set up in!"
 "Athens wasn't built in a day, you know."
* Euanthe waits patiently as the arguments hopefully keep quiet enough to not be heard.
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "well, is there a higher story window we can enter at?
<Euanthe> "The longer we wait, the more likely they will find us."
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "Euanthe, my friend, I trust you implicitly in all matters marshall, I shall do as you suggest."
<Kirveis> "So which is it? Send someone up top with rope and break in through the roof, or have two of us squeeze in at ground level, distract the guards, surround them, kill them and head up?"
* Euanthe shrugs, "High ground."
<Naboo_> "If we try and stay unnoticed, it would be much safer to go by roof."
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "who has rope?"
<Evel> (If none you have it, I'll just say one of the other PCs do that are sick :P )
<Naboo_> (Ya, I was going to ask if we could take from someone that isn't hear.)
<Evel> ( assume you do then )
<Euanthe> (no room for it :( )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (who goes to the top?)
<Naboo_> (I have +2 stealth :l )
<Evel> (Invisibility? xD )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> wizards?
<Naboo_> (Vanish...)
<Evel> ( Well since you guys were mocking Evel for being a slave-wizard, I suppose I could have him cast one casting of Invis. xD )
<Naboo_> (So is he a wizard?)
<Evel> ( I wasn't planning on him being one. )
 ( But since you guys seem to need help :P )
<Kirveis> (I can cast invisibility. Once.)
 (Didn't think I'd need multiple castings.)
<Evel> ( Ah okay. Then forget I said anything ^_^ )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (we only need one, the first person up there.)
 (Perhaps send a rogue?)
<Evel> ( The rogues have the shits. )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (who goes?)
* Euanthe volunteers.
<Naboo_> (Does anyone else have much in Stealth?)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "I will imbue you with the power to cast darkness."
<Kirveis> (So we're sending up an invisible and gaseous Euanthe with rope?)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> Imbue with spell-like ability, darkness, too
* Euanthe "A.. alright. Not sure why I need that though."
<Naboo_> (Invisible Gas, perfect.)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "or would you prefer Enthrall?, euanthe?"
<Evel> ( It seems to fit tonight's Theme: Montezuma's Revenge! )
<Euanthe> ( what does enthrall do? )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/enthrall.html#_enthrall
<dice-bot> [ Enthrall ] - http://paizo.com
<Euanthe> ( aren't we trying to be subtle? )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (it is more insurance.)
<Euanthe> (you can cast it, but she doesn't know what it is)
<Evel> ( Enthrall is not subtle, that is correct :) )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/imbueWithSpellAbility.html#_imbue-with-spell-ability
<dice-bot> [ Imbue with Spell Ability ] - http://paizo.com
<Euanthe> (do whatever you want, lol)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> pick 2 1 level cleric spells, or 1 2nd level.
<Euanthe> (this is just rp, she really doesn't know what she can use it for)
 (regardless of the spell :P))
<Evel> ( If we are set on the plan...we may want to start moving. We only have like an hour >.> )
<Euanthe> (agreed, just cast darkness for me )
<Kirveis> (Gogogogogo!)
<Evel> ( Shall I fast forward then? )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> kk
<Naboo_> (Seriously, I think we've been planning for 2 hours now.)
<Evel> ( Yes. )
 ( You guys waiting for night? )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> go
 imbue with spell, invis, gas
<Euanthe> ( we wait for night )
 (then all this stuff happens
<Evel> ( kay ty )
<Euanthe> )
<Evel> The group reached the tower easily enough, there were virtually no guards at this time except for the handle guarding entrances to what looked like a couple slave barracks and the tower. The massive stone structure, about 40' tall, dominated the center of the town and provided a clear view [probably for fire fighting and such, it allowed an observer to view the entire city from the top]. 
 Euanthe reached the top and secured the rope easily to one of the wood posts that supported the bell at the top of the tower. It was the only place to tie them too up there. The rope was long enough to reach the ground level for the rest of the party to ascend. The top of the tower was made of stone. The party scurried up the rope easily enough and were all now situated on the the tower's roof. There was a trap door near the bell f
 or entry into the rest of the tower.
* Kirveis whispers quietly, "Well dang, that simplifies things a bit."
<Naboo_> (Well dang
 (wat)
 (I'm assuming you would use Perception to check for traps?)
<Evel> ( Yes )
<Naboo_> .roll 1d20+3 Check for traps
<dice-bot> Naboo_ : 1d20+3 Check for traps = 8 | [5] | 5+3 Check for traps | 
<Naboo_> (i be dauh beest trep-foonder)
<Evel> ( Naboo_: No traps were found. )
* Euanthe goes to open the trap door quietly.
--> Naboo__ (6bc0d614@gateway/web/freenode/ip.107.192.214.20) has joined ##Colonists
<Naboo__> (Anyone else get some weird Invalid Session?)
<Euanthe> (nope)
<Evel> The chamber beneath the trap door was empty and dark. It looked dusty, as if it had been left unused for sometime. There were wooden boxes everywhere.
<Naboo__> (Well don't mind Naboo_ , I'm the REAL Naboo)
<-- Naboo_ has quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (I don't believe you, doppleganger.)
 oh.
<Evel> ( :P )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> :(
* Naboo__ pulls of human mask to reveal a raptor
 Euanthe gesutres for others to follow as I enter.
<Naboo__> (Sorry)
<Evel> ( Derailed again....do you guys just want to call it a night then? xD )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> Lets get it done.
<Naboo__> (No no, when do we usually finish?)
<Evel> ( 10. )
 ( Continue then but at this rate the encounter might be hard to get in XD )
* Kirveis slithers down into the room and looks around.
<Euanthe> ( perception? )
<Evel> ( Roll if you want to but the room is harmless )
<Euanthe> (then onwards!)
* Felix_The_Pensiv drops down into room
<Evel> The chamber has only one exit and the sweet sounds of music can be heard drifting in from the room next door.
 (Ya, I'm really simplifying this >.> )
* Euanthe peeks inside if it isn't locked, doing so quietly.
<Euanthe> ( stealth? )
<Evel> ( Yes. )

<Evel> Euanthe saw two large guards, bulky, and equipped with longswords and some sort of bronze armor which surrounded a small throne, which presumably, sat the warlord. He was a massive, heavily muscled Nubian with a massive sword leaned against his thigh. Two naked women were also in the chamber, one dancing and one playing a flute. Their breasts swayed with the music, too focused on their performance to notice the reaction of the male
  Nubians.
 [ Kirveis -> Felix -> Euanthe -> Naboo is your init order, since Naboo didn't roll yet. NPCs act last.]
<Naboo__> (Didn't realize.)
<Evel> [ Its fine, roll now if oyu want ]

<dice-bot> Naboo__ : 1d20+6 = 7 | [1] | 1+6 | 
<Kirveis> (Can I see into the room yet, or would I need to move over to the trapdoor first?)

<Naboo__> (Does Inspire Competence focus a specific ally?)
<Evel> The tiger pinned the guard to the wall with its teeth in the man's throat. He struggled weakly against the creature.

<Kirveis> (Is from a silly old camp song.)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> I figure out the tower head first.
<Evel> [ Which him? There is 3. Two guards (grappled one, one held) and the warlord. ]
<Euanthe> The warlord

<Evel> [ xD ]
<Naboo__> (I can still move right?)
<Evel> The bolt penetrated slightly into the Warlord's armor, he suffered a papercut.
 [ Isn't loading the crossbow a move action? ]
 [ So I figured your action this round was move -> fire ]
<Naboo__> (I was planning to drop it and use Perform)
 (Is dropping a crossbow an action?)

<Evel> [ They'd all be in range ]
 The warlord's guard struggled against the tiger ineffectually [earlier roll]. The warlord, seeing his man badly injured, grabbed his weapon and swung at the beast.

<Evel> [ Dead? ]
<Kirveis> Is his weapon evil?
 If not, the tiger is at 15 hp.
<Evel> [ Kay. For purposes of DR, it does count as evil ]
<Kirveis> Then he's at 5.
<Evel> [ -nods- I believe its your turn ]
<Kirveis> The naked slaves do nothing?
<Evel> [ More or less, yes. They are in shock. ]
<Kirveis> I cast Haste on all of us, including the tiger, and order him to keep mauling the guard and then the warlord.
<Evel> [ Rolls if you would ]
<Kirveis> (Everyone gains a move action or a bonus attack when making a full round attack, +1 to attacks, +1 to AC, and +1 to Reflex.)
 The tiger stops grappling (free action) and starts clawing and biting again.

<Evel> The tiger's claws strike the stone wall behind the guard, snapping one claw in half as the creature yelped [-1 hp, so 4]. The pain distracted the creature and every follow up blow went wide during its assault.

 [ Anyway, Felix, attack roll and target? ]

<Evel> The Warlord staggered beneath the blow, blood smearing against his cheek and painting his armor.

<Kirveis> (Important thing is +12 hp for the tiger. Not quite so near to death.)
<Evel> The warlord yelped as the blade sliced deeply into his armor and cut his left arm deeply. Blood from the gash dribbled down the polished bronze finish of his armor.
 [ Next, Naboo__ ]
<Kirveis> (Yay! Kill da warlord!)
<Evel> [ Warlord: -34 (assuming you guys didn't ad dthe +2 to damage), Guard (Mauled): Disabled and bleeding out from tiger+stuff you guys forgot. Guard (Held): -0 ]
* Naboo__ swings his instrument back (It's on a belt thing around his torso) ,reclaims his crossbow and reloads
<Naboo__> (I can attack the same round?)
<Evel> ( Sure, what the hell :P )
<Naboo__> (Also Don't forget about that performance, it lasts another 2 rounds)

<Evel> ( Kirveis: I'm just trying to get to bed, I'm really tired. )
 ( Calm down :P )
<Kirveis> (Sorry, just reminding, who's up?)
<Naboo__> (You I believe)
<Evel> One guard continued to struggle helplessly against Felix's enchantment while the Tiger finished off the other. The Warlord growled and swung at Euanthe repeatedly.

 [ Kirveis ]
* Kirveis summons a large ball of fire and sends it careening in the direction of the warlord. [Reflex DC 18 to negate]
 Kirveis directs her tiger to attack the warlord now.
<Naboo__> (Did we ever do anything about that second guard?)
<Evel> [ You are aware this is an enclosed space and Euanthe is in melee range, correct? You aren't going to be able to prevent some backlash or hitting the tiger ]

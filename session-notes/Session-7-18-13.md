--> Felix_The_Pensiv (~Pocketkni@64.53.181.222) has joined ##Colonists
<Felix_The_Pensiv> helo
<NosFrost> Hey Felix
<Emn1ty> and there he is XD
<NosFrost> Ah yes
 I'm like 'meh no one is coming'
 then 5 min later he shows up :P
<Felix_The_Pensiv> sorry about that, apparently a squirrel decided the electric box looked like a nice place to play.
<Emn1ty> and then they show up :P
<NosFrost> Eh Trystia still isn't here
<Emn1ty> Give it another 20m, she'll probably show
 he'll*
 not sure which
<NosFrost> Maybe, we'll see
<Trystia> I'm here! Sorry!
<Emn1ty> coolio
<Emn1ty> NosFrost
<Emn1ty> so everyone is here then?
<Trystia> Crap, stupid not paying attention to what time it was...
<Emn1ty> lol
<Emn1ty> NosFrost, Spaaaace, Felix_The_Pensiv you all here?
<Felix_The_Pensiv> yes
<Emn1ty> and now NosFrost has disappeared :(
<Spaaaace> hi
<Emn1ty> nobody go anwhere, I don't feel like chasing people down :P
<Trystia> Staying right here...
<NosFrost> Wild Players appear!
<Emn1ty> and so does a wild GM
<NosFrost> I guess we play for like ~3 hours if you guys would like.
<Emn1ty> that's fine :)
<Trystia> Really sorry about that, was putting some furniture together.
<Emn1ty> some time is better than none
<Spaaaace> need beverage, well be back
<NosFrost> Its fine.
 I kinda started playing a game tho. XD
<Trystia> People-not-showing-up-Bingo?
<NosFrost> Sc2 XD
<Spaaaace> i return
<NosFrost> Kay. Everyone know where we left off last time?
<Emn1ty> iirc, we had literally just killed the guy and were going down the tower?
 or is that not correct?
* Trystia had ordered the surviving guard to give his clothes tto the two slave girls.
--- Trystia is now known as Kirveis
<NosFrost> Yes.
 That is correct.
--- You are now known as Masabi
 Spaaaace is now known as Confernicus
 Emn1ty is now known as Euanthe
<Masabi> Masabi growled at the female but saw no alternative. He stripped of his light mesh mail slowly, undoing the straps across his shoulders. The light brown robe he wore beneath his armor followed, leaving him naught but a simple loin cloth. The women, breasts bared and stunned by this change events, mostly just watched the guard. The clothes stank of sweat and beer. The women had no desire to wear them especially since wearing them 
 would be a death sentence if the party failed to bring the local Warlord's troops under control.
<Euanthe> (...)
 (wear them DAMMIT)
 (j/k)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "Well...What now?"
<Masabi> ( P.S. Spaaaace, not sure how you want to handle showing up. You can saw you followed after them, maybe 10 minutes? behind after Evel escaped while you were on the shitter. Or we can do something else. )
<Confernicus> (up to you i'm not familiar with the current situation)
<Masabi> (Basically, rope hanging down over the side of the tower. You'd have just to have climbed up in ~10 min after them and followed the way down. It is a straight shot to where they are. )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (the warlord is dead before us)
<Confernicus> (If i am able i well pursue with haste)
 (Carefully)
<Masabi> ( You'd be able too. )
<Confernicus> (then i do so)
<Masabi> ( Just give them a few min to chat 'mongst themselves then show up :) )
<Confernicus> (very well)
<Masabi> ( Now discuss folks IC or I'll have someone stab you :P )
<Euanthe> (does the warlord have anything representative of his position that would likely only be carried on his person?)
* Kirveis doesn't actually care whether the two accept the clothes or not, so long as the guard makes no attempt to take them back. "You two are now free. You may leave the city if you wish, but I hope you stay. We shall be rebuilding it properly, and there will be a place for you if you like. It may not make up for your treatment at this thug..." I hiss at the dead warlord, "... but you 
 Kirveis shall be free as long as we remain in power."
<Masabi> ( He was sitting on a throne...does that qualify? But nothing mobile.)
<Euanthe> (ok… was gonna go outside and throw his helmet or something XD)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "Perhaps we should secure the tower."
* Euanthe nods
<Masabi> The stunned women simply nodded to Kirveis. They did not really believe she would be able to keep her word due to the sheer number of mercenaries on the Isle.
 ( Kay xD Could just toss the body....but it'll splat pretty hard )
<Euanthe> (splatting is demoralizing right?)
* Kirveis turns to the guard now, "We're not taking any slaves, only freeing them, but you are going to have to do something to compensate those you have abused here."
<Kirveis> "What do you all think... amnesty for hard labour rebuilding the city?"
<Euanthe> "Sounds fine to me."
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "agreed."
<Kirveis> And... about this time the tiger finally goes poof.
<Masabi> ( Kinda sorta, aye )
 ( But would they recognize a splatted warlord? Unlikely )
<Euanthe> (well, maybe if I yelled that it was him)
* Masabi shrugged at the them. He did not want to die.
* Confernicus enters the room by rope
<Masabi> ( Eh, why would they believe you tho? XD )
<Kirveis> (I could feather fall him down to the ground?)
<Masabi> ( That would solve the problem. )
<Confernicus> (hang him from the window we have rope
<Euanthe> (^)
 (sounds good)
<Masabi> ( Also a valid option )
<Kirveis> (By 80' fly speed, how long to go from here back to the ship?)
<Masabi> ( Days. )
 ( Its on the far side of the island :/ )
 ( I hate how google music keeps re-organizing my radio stations >.> )
<Kirveis> (I thought it only took us days because we were on foot...)
<Masabi> ( Yes. It took you like 5. )
 ( 5/2.5 = 2
 )
 ( Its not like you crossed a mountain )
<Kirveis> (So... are we hanging him or dropping him?)
<Confernicus> (Hanging)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (hanging is traditionally the way to go...or impaled on spikes....)
<Masabi> ( Hang away, gentlemen )
 ( And someone roll an intimidate check for me :P )
<Euanthe> ( I will I guess )
<Confernicus> "Spikes are their game, blood and rotting flesh, We shall hang the corpse, let them know that we are not them, and because of this we are to be feared"
<Kirveis> "Ah, Confernicus, you are feeling better? Is Fabius still with Evel?"
<Euanthe> .roll 1d20+11
<dice-bot> Euanthe : 1d20+11 = 20 | [9] | 9+11 |  
* Euanthe drops him and lets him hang from the neck pretty hard.
 Confernicus "It's still hazy for me, I lost track of both of them i'm afraid."
<Kirveis> "We'll go find them once things are under control."
<Euanthe> (that was intimidate, btw)
<Masabi> There were shouts that could be heard from the street below. The hanging had the desired effect, more or less. About half of the guards fled for the ships in the harbor or the countryside. The other half...the other half was less impressed. About fifty of the Warlord's men were surrounding the Watchtower now but none were in a hurry to get inside.
* Euanthe looks out the window, shouting, "Lay down your weapons, your ruler has fallen!"
 Confernicus looks out the window down to the men of the late warlord
<Kirveis> (Crap! We could have used those ships!)
<Confernicus> "are these men even worth it?"
<Euanthe> (oh well)
<Masabi> ( IF you can Fly, you'd beat them to the ships. )
<Euanthe> "Don't underestimate them."
<Confernicus> (They need to port somewhere, we can seek them out if we must)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "It is time to stop living like rats in a crumbling ruin! Come build a glorious city with us!"
<Euanthe> (ha)
<Masabi> [ Someone roll Diplomacy or the like to try to convince them :P ]
<Kirveis> (I can't. Bephnora can, but there's not much she could do.)
<Confernicus> "Euanthe, this is why i doubt them, they well be trouble, not easy trouble to deal with either."
<Euanthe> "Do you propose we wait them out then?"
<Confernicus> (i can try diplomacy, not my specialty but i have ranks)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> .roll 1d20+13
<dice-bot> Felix_The_Pensiv : 1d20+13 = 31 | [18] | 18+13 |  
<Felix_The_Pensiv> bam
<Euanthe> (well that's solved)
<Confernicus> "Let's be patient"
<Kirveis> "So what would you do with them? Kill them all? We'll not have slaves in this city, and I'll not stand by and see them murdered if they drop their weapons and surrender."
<Masabi> The party saw about two third of the guards look at their fellows with a gleam in the eye and backed away, dispersing into the city. There were still about 20 or so of the guards left, however.
<Kirveis> (Shit. They're going to go grab a bunch of slaves and flee with them.)
<Confernicus> "I am an assassin, not a warmaster, I am just asking if it is worth trying to win them over, any man willing to cooperate of course well be offered a hand."
<Felix_The_Pensiv> sense motive
 .roll 1d20+15
<dice-bot> Felix_The_Pensiv : 1d20+15 = 19 | [4] | 4+15 |  
<Masabi> ( Yes, you took no precautions but to be fair they can't take many. They want to get away as well after all :P These aren't big ships. )
 ( What for Felix ? )
<Confernicus> (It's an island, control the ships and only so many can escape)
<Masabi> (Eh, my point was they don't have 100% transport capacity. )
 ( They have more like 100% for the mercenaries )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (the remaining 20 soldiers)
<Masabi> ( ...they obviously plan to attack you :P )
<Euanthe> "I'm fine with waiting them out if you desire." she says, putting away her weapon.
<Confernicus> "We're not going to have much of a head start, bah to them, where are the food stores?"
* Euanthe shakes her head, "I'd assume below."
<Masabi> ( Someone roll a knowledge check for Knowledge [Local] )
<Confernicus> "This is what happens when i get sick, remind me not to plan any vacations"
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "Well, either way, we need to secure the tower.
<Kirveis> .roll 1d20+10
<dice-bot> Kirveis : 1d20+10 = 27 | [17] | 17+10 |  
<Masabi> ( The food stores are in the silos nearby, not in the tower itself )
<Confernicus> "We could burn them"
<Euanthe> ( hm… )
<Kirveis> (The 20 Nubians are still below, gathered and waiting for a chance to attack us, yes?)
<Masabi> ( Stone silos, small doors. Not easy to burn without a fireball spell or getting to em direct )
<Confernicus> (The food)
<Masabi> ( More or less, yes. There is some argument over who should be in charge of the attack. )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> (we are going to want that food)
<Masabi> ( To get to the food, you have to get past the stone walls and heavy wood doors )
<Kirveis> (How close together are they?)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> I say we pelt them in classic "we are in a fort" style.
<Masabi> ( The guards or the silos? )
<Kirveis> (The guards.)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> 5 are worth 50 in a fort.
<Confernicus> "If you pansies can't figure out who's your best man i'd be happy to test some sword arms for you!"
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "what do we have here in the tower?"
 "we should search."
<Euanthe> "Perhaps we should just secure the tower first?"
<Confernicus> "We can always bust down a stair case, and pelt them as they come"
* Euanthe starts walking down the steps to the next level.
 Felix_The_Pensiv follows
 Confernicus follows close
--- You are now known as BBR
<BBR> The next floor was empty except for some bed chambers, presumably for the guards and their two sex slaves. The tower was not particularly large around, merely tall, to better keep watch for fires in the port town. The staircases were made of wood. There was four bedchambers in total.
* Euanthe goes to the next level.
 Confernicus continues to follow
 Kirveis remains up top and confers with Bephnora, trying to come up with a plan while keeping an eye on the guards.
<Euanthe> (I smell something good and I'm hungry, may need to go get something pretty quick in a bit)
<BBR> ( Kay )
 The second floor was the kitchens and dining area. There looked to be another female slave chained to a metal stove [literally] as she cooked something that smelled like fish and baked bread in a clay oven nearby.
* Confernicus examines the chains
<BBR> They are basic and bronze. You'd have no trouble picking the poorly constructed lock that seals them on the end around her bossom.
* Felix_The_Pensiv asks the woman "do you know where the keys are?"
 Confernicus picks the lock
 Euanthe watchs the stairs.
<Confernicus> (do you want the roll, or is it trivial?"
<Euanthe> (Watches*)
<BBR> ( Trivial )
 ( You can do it on a take 10 )
<Confernicus> take 10 + 6
<BBR> The woman shook her head and smiled as Confernicus picked the lock successfully. Her hands bumped her breasts as she shifted the chains around her breasts to free herself. She smiled and bowed slightly at her saviors. "Thank you!"
<Confernicus> "Find somewhere safe, do not go further down, until we have cleared the siege"
<Kirveis> (The Nubians outside still haven't organized?)
<BBR> She nodded and glanced at the stairs to the bedroom level. "Did you kill the Warlord?"
 ( Maybe, maybe not ;) )
 ( They haven't broken down the door yet. )
<Kirveis> (But... but I'm keeping an eye on them!)
<Confernicus> "The warlord hangs from this very tower"
<BBR> (Oh! Sorry!)
 The slave girl nodded to them and proceeded upstairs, presumably to check on the other slaves.
<Felix_The_Pensiv> "whoever has that crossbow should start taking pot shots to hamper their progress
* Confernicus waits for her to be out of site
<Confernicus> "You know what i miss?"
<Euanthe> "What?"
<Confernicus> "Brothels"
<BBR> The sound of a heavy piece of wood, probably a makeshift battering ram, against the heavy wood doors of the tower could be heard.
<Confernicus> "Anyway let's get moving"
 "Shit"
 "We need a choke point"
<BBR> A scream echoed through the tower as the sound of the ram stopped.
<Confernicus> "What was that?"
 (Where did it come from?"
<BBR> (Below, probably one of the guards around the battering ram)
 [1 of 7]
* Euanthe heads down to take a peek.
<Kirveis> I scream down at the Nubians, "And there's more where that came from if you lot don't surrender!"
<BBR> ( Down to the first floor, Euanthe? )
 [2 of 7]
<Euanthe> (whatever the next level is)
<BBR> ( Aye )
 Euanthe arrives at what looks like a small armory for the city guards, weapons and a sealed chamber that might be the Warlord's treasury off to one side. There were no windows and only the barest crack of light through the slightly damaged wooden door. Something black and slimy was moving rapidly but you saw naught else.
<Euanthe> (black and slimy...)
* Confernicus follows
<BBR> [3 of 7]
* Euanthe moves on, keeping an eye out for that… black thing
<BBR> ( Moves on to wear? Main door is locked. )
<Euanthe> (oh, I thought there was more levels)
<BBR> ( Nope. First floor )
<Euanthe> (ok… welp, I look around for the black thing then.)
<BBR> [4 of 7]
 (Its on the outside of the door )
 (Not the inside )
<Euanthe> (oh… well then I check the supposed treasury?)
 (how sturdy is the door?)
<BBR> ( Very. You'd need help to break it down. )
<Euanthe> (ok, then I make sure nothing gets through the currently damage door)
<BBR> [5 of 7]
 Seconds pass...
 (If no one does anything, skipping to the end of the spell in 2 minutes)
<Euanthe> (i'm waiting, so readied action essentially)
<Confernicus> (readied action as well, draw my blades, slashing damage)
<BBR> The black slithery thing on the other side of the door has vanished from view. However, there does not appear to be any immediate threat.
 ( Fyi, the door is 'bout 8' across, so two guards could enter at a time once they break it down )
* Euanthe wonders why the door is damaged then...
<BBR> ( Once Kirveis decides her action, you'll find out :P )
* Euanthe stays in position a bit longer, seeing if it just happens to be the calm before the storm
<BBR> A heavy wooden log ['bout 2m long, 1m around] is slammed into the door, hard. The wood splinters beneath the blow.
* Euanthe throws a javelin through the opening.
<Felix_The_Pensiv> Can mend repair the door?
<BBR> ( Yes. )
 ( Attack roll with a -4, its a very narrow opening, Euanthe )
<Euanthe> .roll 1d20+4
<dice-bot> Euanthe : 1d20+4 = 17 | [13] | 13+4 |  
<BBR> The javelin sticks into the battering ram as it slams into the door again.
<Kirveis> (Mending has a 10 minute cast time though.)
<Euanthe> (oh, wow)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> lightning attack through the gaps then?
<BBR> ( Aye )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> I will rain destruction upon them!
 2 at a time
<BBR> ( Rolls and/or DC if you please )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> how many are manning the battering ram?
<BBR> 6
<Felix_The_Pensiv> its lightning arc, so I would like to go down the left side and mark the first and last guy

 ( DC? )
<Felix_The_Pensiv> 20

<BBR> The men take the blast in stride, suffering the light damage as the ram slams into the door again. One of the rammers looks badly injured.

<Kirveis> I then command them to attack anyone with dark skin and holding a metal weapon down on the ground.
 (Up near where I am.)
<BBR> ( Ah okay )

<Kirveis> I order the elementals to harry the fleeing guards for as long as they can (until spell expires), then turn to head back inside the tower.
<BBR> Euanthe notes that her breasts are flowing out of her armor a bit.

<Kirveis> I check that the two former slaves are alright and that the guard who surrendered is still behaving himself.
<Euanthe> And I thought it went away...
<BBR> He seemed to be molesting one of the slave girls but she did not seem to mind too much.
<Kirveis> "Your friends have all fled the city. You will be needed downstairs to assist in burying them. Go."
<BBR> The woman pouted prettily at Kirveis and the guard shrugged and went downstairs as commanded.
<Kirveis> "I'm sorry I have no proper clothes for either of you, but I suppose you're probably used to being unclad by now. I intend to let the slaves know what has happened if they're not already aware, will they be able to come here if the guards have all fled?"
* Confernicus Starts heading back up the stairs
<BBR> The women shrugged but the one who didn't seem to mind the guard nodded and said, "About half of the slaves, as far as I know, are locked behind the barracks doors around the grain silos for moving and serving the soldiers. You should be nicer to him, he really isn't that bad y'know? He saved me from being assigned to the brothels."
 [ The squat buildings that lined the city streets, the intact ones from last session, are what she is talking 'bout when she says barracks. The silos are just two story buildings as well so they aren't going to be easy to distinguish from each other but it'll be obvious once you open a door. ]
<Kirveis> "I will take that under consideration then. He's already in a far better position than his compatriots though. We were forced to kill quite a few before they fled. Is there anything else we should know?"
 (Too bad I'm not 8th level for what I'm going to do next...)
<BBR> The woman shrugged. "The farm slaves and brothel slaves got it the worst, mistress."
 ( Eh, at the end of this session you will be. )
<Kirveis> "Where are the brothel slaves kept? In town, yes?"
 "In the barracks?"
<BBR> ( I wanted you to be not-quite-8 to balance out the loot from the treasury you'd get 0
 *)
 The woman just nodded and looked away.
<Kirveis> "Will you come and help me free them? You may remain here if you wish."
<BBR> The woman just stared out the woman and shook her head.
 ( Ya...she really, really does not want to go into that sort of place. A day or two is enough to scar a person for life. )
<Kirveis> (I figured as much.)
* Kirveis gives each of the two a hug, then heads back up to the top of the tower... *Ghost Sound*
<BBR> The women hug her back, slight warmth in each hug.
 ( Fyi, calling it at 10pm PST / 1am EST )
<Kirveis> At maximum volume (28 voices worth, where 32 voices is a roaring dragon) I declare, "This city is under new management! All slaves are free, from this day henceforth!" I then ask Bephnora if she'd mind flying out to our ship and letting them know it's time to head on over to the harbour.
* Confernicus enters
<Confernicus> "add in amnesty for anyone slaver or guard who pledges service to the city"
<BBR> Belphnora simply floated up into the air rather than respond. She had a job to do!
 ( The slaves are locked down at night, sealed doors, etc. )
* Euanthe loosens her armor, finding that adjusting it was not working
<Kirveis> "Any guard or slaver who surrenders their weapons and pledges service and loyalty to us shall receive our amnesty. Those who do not shall be tried as criminals!"
 (Okay, back to normal volume.)
<BBR> ( Do you want to wait to see if anyone shows up? )
<Kirveis> "We need to go set the slaves free. Many were locked up in the barracks, forced to serve sexually."
<Confernicus> "I'll go take care of that, you keep a look out, make sure we know whats going on"
* Confernicus heads back down towards the barracks
<BBR> ( I assume you break into the first Brothel you found? )
<Confernicus> (the first building harboring slaves, if it happens to be a brothel all the better)
<Kirveis> "There should be a woman there when we set them free."
<BBR> Little seemed to happen as Confernicus broke into the first brothel he found. There was some feminine sobbing from a number of sealed chambers in the barracks.
<Confernicus> "I'll get Euanthe"
<BBR> ( Oops. )
 ( Assume that happens whenever you two sort that out )
<Confernicus> (ok)
* Euanthe is standing in the corner, removing her armor.
<Euanthe> "If I just put it on like this it should fit..."
<BBR> ( The boobs aren't going to get back in that armor, you need to stick with just clothes for the chest. The rest you can sort half-manage I suppose. )
<Euanthe> (T-T)
* Euanthe drops the breastplate, "Dammit"
<BBR> ( You've gained like 3 cups >.> )
<Euanthe> (I know… I'm keeping track)
<BBR> ( Since that armor was made XD )
 ( Okay )
<Kirveis> I'll head back inside, "Do either of you know if the warlord had a key to the treasury somewhere in here?"
* Euanthe goes with Confernicus.
<BBR> The women shook their heads.
 <BBR> Little seemed to happen as Confernicus broke into the first brothel he found. There was some feminine sobbing from a number of sealed chambers in the barracks. [ For Conf, Eua]
* Euanthe goes to check on those crying, informing them of what's happened.
 Confernicus starts breaking open sealed chambers
<Kirveis> I will... start searching the tower in detail. Maybe there's something to find in the bedrooms.
<BBR> The women mostly react with shock and just curl up on their soiled, filthy beds. There is very little of interest here and the women appear....broken...for lack of a better term. They are frightened, woman or not.
* Euanthe attempts to open doors.
<BBR> [ Kirveis: You find luxurious beddings, etc in 3 of the bedrooms. Probably for his two personal guards and the Warlord. The last bedroom had three simple cots, for the slave girls probably, and nothing else. Your search reveals little of value other than some written records regarding the status of the storehouses, etc. The granaries are nearly full which is slightly odd. ]
 Euanthe finds every slave's cell is locked and she needs to kick them in or wait for Confernicus to get to the ones she tries.
<Euanthe> (probably am not strong enough to break them)

<Kirveis> I'll gather up all the records and read through them in detail later. If there's no key, we'll just have to break into the treasury.
<Euanthe> "Thank you."
<BBR> [ Did you check his body Kirveis? XD ]
 [ Succeeds, Felix ]
<Kirveis> (No...)
<BBR> [ Anyway, lets call it a night here if that works and I just prepare a status sheet for who escapes/stays and so forth and you start city-building/holding court/et al?]
<Kirveis> (Did we not check him before hanging him from the tower?)
<Felix_The_Pensiv> ok

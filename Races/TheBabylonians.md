# Babylonians, God's Chosen People

 * A tanned people with dark brown hair - http://iranpoliticsclub.net/history/historical-women/images/Shirin%201.jpg
 * The Babylonians loathe all magic except that which is wielded by the servants of the One True God. At the height of the Masadan Empire, they were its slaves and died to build Masadan monuments, like the Pyramids. They were able to rebel around fifty years ago when Masda's troubles started and they've been independent ever since. The Purifiers of the One True God cleanse their people of the 'taint' of Masadan-style sorcery and exterminate slavers. The Purifiers are widely viewed as a relentless, merciless force but they are not entirely unreasonable.

* A large, genderless race of slaves created by the people of the Desert of the Damned for heavy labor, Elifs can
travel great distances across the desert quickly, but lack the mobility for finer crafts. They were given
intelligence, and as a result of their slow movements developed a deep-thinking way of life. Very few members of
this race ever see freedom. They tend to speak drawl when they speak.		
* Racial stats:
	* Large size (7): +2 strength, -2 dexterity, -1 size penalty to AC, -1 size attack roll penalty, +1 CMD and
	  CMB size bonus, -4 size penalty to stealth.

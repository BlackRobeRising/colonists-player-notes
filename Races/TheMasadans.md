# Masdans, The People of Masada, The Children of the First Empire

 * Dark skinned humans with long black hair - http://dodd.cmcvellore.ac.in/hom/01%20-%20Medicine%20in%20Ancient%20Egypt.jpg
 * Masdans are generally average in most respects except for their towering intellects. It was this natural intelligence and curiousity that ultimately destroyed them, they called up dark forces to weaken them from within while their subpar strength was pitted against the mighty Nubian hordes. Thirty years have passed but a few of them remain free, dreaming of freedom for their homeland.
 * Racial Stats:
	* Humanoid (Human) (+0)
	* Medium (+0) - Medium races have no bonuses or penalties due to their size. A Medium creature has a space of 5 feet by 5 feet and a reach of 5 feet.
	* Greater Paragon (2 RP) - -2 Str, -2 Wis, +4 Int
	* Curiousity (4 RP) - They gain a +4 bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information, and Knowledge (history) and Knowledge (local) become class skills for them. If they choose a class that has either of these Knowledge skills as class skills, they gain a +2 racial bonus on those skills instead.
	* Vengance Shall Be Ours (9 RP) - Light or Darkness, a Masadan sees with equal ease. Darkness never obscures their vision, even spells like Deeper Darkness. They gain a +1 to Attack Rolls & Spell DCs against Outsiders, Undead, and Nubians.

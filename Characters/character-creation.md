# Character Creation [Main PC]

 * Alignment: The party must all be either Neutral & Evil or Neutral & Good on the Good/Evil axis. (E.g. LG/NG/CG + LN/NN/CN OR LE/NE/CE + LN/NN/CN) Creation of Undead is a Neutral or Evil act (depending on use).
 * Starting Level: 7
 * Common is replaced with Masadan, as it was the common trade tongue of the region before Masada's fall.
 * 25 Point Buy - http://plothook.net/tools/pointbuy.htm [if you need a calculator]
 * Standard Pathfinder Races are available. To some degree, player choices will decide the major races in the region. I'm going to be picking 5 but the other 4 will be based on the party, so just keep that in mind. If none of you pick humans, we may have a no-human game. ;) That said, the NPC races are all going to be human-based so there will be humans but not the base race 'human'.
	* The five NPC races are going to be: The Masdans [Few remain], The Atlantians [Masters of the Rising Empire of the East (Roman analogue)], The Corinthians [The Fracitious City-States of the Peloponnese], The Babylonians [The Theocrats of the One-True-God], The Nubians [The Barbarians who overran the Masadan Empire from the Deep South]
	* http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedRaceGuide/coreRaces.html <- +1 bonus feat (Highest core race is 11 RP, so 11 RP + 4 RP [feat] = 15 RP)
	* http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedRaceGuide/featuredRaces.html <- these races go as high as 17 RP, so I'm not giving them a boost.
	* http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advancedRaceGuide/raceBuilder.html <- You can request to make a race with this with 15 RP.
 * 2 Traits - I may homebrew some regional traits in line with these, if requested. - http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/advanced/advancedNewRules.html#_traits
 * 24,000 gp in personal wealth to equip your PC with
 * Magic Availability is assumed to be normal for Character Creation. (e.g. Buy what you like) However, it is safe to assume outside a major City-state it is going to be unavailable for purchase except in small quantities (under 751gp).
 * HP is just full first / average after (e.g. d6 is 3.5)
 * I'll allow 3.5 Material on a case-by-case basis. Generally, if you ask for more than a couple feats and/or a PrC, expect the answer to be No. Expect the answer to be No to anything that reduces Metamagic costs with the exception of Metamagic School Focus and other uses-per-day reducers. Anything requested from 3.5 will be added to the Campaign in general and available to NPCs and PCs alike.

# Character Assets

 * Party Assets:
	* One Ship [ http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/ultimateCombatVehicles.html ]
	* One Crew [ 40 Sailors - 39 Commoner 1, 1 Expert 7 (Captain) ]
	* 90 Days of rations & pay for the crew.
 * Pick One per PC (multiples stack, so two Mercenary Companies would provide twice as many troops AND even better troop access at the start):
	* Mercenary Company [ 2 units of Cavalry or 4 units of Infantry (20 Warrior 1 = 1 Unit), just realize this would fill the ship when you include food. Provides access to professional troops for the Colony allowing you to raise a professional, first rate military from the start.]
	* Merchant Concern [ A second ship, as above. OR Starting with a passive income for the Colony. Either way, you grow trade with other city-states faster. ]
	* Master Artificers [ You have access to a small group of artificers who can produce magic items for sale, use, or trade. You can buy magical items at 90% of the usual price and sell them at 60% (instead of 50%) of the normal price. The larger the colony the more frequently you can purchase magical items. This ability starts with 2 per Season (90 days) and expands from there. In addition, you will have standard access to Magic (e.g. As if the Colony was one of the major city-states) rather than a more limited version. ]
	* Information Broker [ You have access to a second-rate spy network that is funded from criminal operations abroad from the start. It isn't perfect, but it is capable of providing you with valuable information. In addition, your PCs would be less vulnerable to assassination attempts and other espionage actions. ]
	* Religious Order [ You are the leader of a minor religious sect in the region. Your colony will grow faster (population-wise) from the Faithful flocking to you. The PC will get a greater latitude when dealing with religious 'issues' (e.g. Paladin Atonement) for themselves and other members of the sect. You gain the ability to build Temples recognized by your deity. ]
	* Scholars [ You control a secular, academic institution of some kind that seeks a permanent home. You are able to make new Discoveries faster than another city-state (you gain a free R&D action each turn to try to discover something new, basically), potentially providing you with economic, military, magical, or other advantages. However, be warned, R&D is a time consuming effort and it could be years IC before such research bears fruit. In addition, the PC gains a Skill Focus feat for one knowledge skill as bonus feat and that Skill is a class skill if it was not already.]
	* Master Artisans [ You control a small guild skilled in a specific area (e.g. Engineers, Alchemists, Armorers). Items of this type are cheaply available (90% of the usual price in the colony). In addition, your Colony gains a larger starting income as well as slightly faster economic growth. ]
	* Slavers [ __Evil PC Alignment required__. You are a vile and detested slaver, trading in people. This provides you with certain advantages and certain difficulties. You have relatively easy access to monsters/people to work in the mines, the fields, and so forth. This provides you with a sigificant income advantage in an ancient historical period and amplifies economic growth. The downside is there are a number of religious and secular groups who want to put your head on a pike. You fall under the 'magic user' category in the eyes of Purifiers and Purifiers are basically 'lol, you use magic/are evil? DIE DIE' Inquistors. Purifiers are frequently Inquisitor (Witch Hunter or Spellbreaker) but there are other types. So if you are a Magic User and a Slaver? Well, price on your head by name you can expect. ] 
	* Black Magic [ __Evil PC Alignment required__. You are a vile and detested wielder of the foulest magics. You gain access to the BoVD sacrifice rules (Dark Craft XP/gp to spend on magic item creation), the ability to build Temples recognized by the foulest of creatures, and a small cult of followers. Consider this the Evil equivalent of the Religious Order. You are immediately in the top 10 targets of the Purifiers if you choose this option.]

# Leadership
 * Don't take it as a Feat, thanks. You'll be getting a psuedo-leadership like ability from the resources you have at your disposal and I never liked the feat.

# Character Creation [Main PC]

 * Starting Level 7
 * 25 Point Buy - http://plothook.net/tools/pointbuy.htm [if you need a calculator]
 * Standard Pathfinder Races are available. To some degree, player choices will decide the major races in the region. I'm going to be picking 4 but the other 4 will be based on the party, so just keep that in mind. If none of you pick humans, we may have a no-human game. ;)

 * 24,000 gp in personal wealth to equip your PC with
 * Magic Availability is assumed to be normal for Character Creation. (e.g. Buy what you like) However, it is safe to assume outside a major City-state it is going to be unavailable for purchase except in small quantities (under 751gp).
 * HP is just full first / average after (e.g. d6 is 3.5)

# Character Assets

 * Party Assets:
	* One Ship [ http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/ultimateCombatVehicles.html ]
	* One Crew [ 40 Sailors - 39 Commoner 1, 1 Expert 7 (Captain) ]
	* 90 Days of rations & pay for the crew.
 * Pick One per PC (multiples stack, so two Mercenary Companies would provide twice as many troops AND even better troop access at the start):
	* Mercenary Company [ 2 units of Cavalry or 4 units of Infantry (20 Warrior 1 = 1 Unit), just realize this would fill the ship when you include food. Provides access to professional troops for the Colony allowing you to raise a professional, first rate military from the start.]
	* Merchant Concern [ A second ship, as above. OR Starting with a passive income for the Colony. Either way, you grow trade with other city-states faster. ]
	* Master Artificers [ You have access to a small group of artificers who can produce magic items for sale, use, or trade. You can buy magical items at 90% of the usual price and sell them at 60% (instead of 50%) of the normal price. The larger the colony the more frequently you can purchase magical items. This ability starts with 2 per Season (90 days) and expands from there. In addition, you will have standard access to Magic (e.g. As if the Colony was one of the major city-states) rather than a more limited version. ]
	* Information Broker [ You have access to a second-rate spy network that is funded from criminal operations abroad from the start. It isn't perfect, but it is capable of providing you with valuable information. In addition, your PCs would be less vulnerable to assassination attempts and other espionage actions. ]

# Leadership
 * Don't take it as a Feat, thanks. You'll be getting a psuedo-leadership like ability from the resources you have at your disposal and I never liked the feet.

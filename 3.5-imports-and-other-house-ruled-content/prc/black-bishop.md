 # Black Bishop, False Priests of the Lower Planes	
	
	The Black Bishops are the self-serving servants of Daemons, Demons, and Devils. Their pacts are generally relatively simple, provide souls for the Lords Below and do not whine if a token service is required from time to time in their name.

	They are required to undergo a damning ceremony that tests their endurance (DC 15 Fort Save or Die, if we are playing it to the hilt. Feel free to skip this if not appropriate for you.).

 * Skills: Bluff 4 ranks, Use Magic Device 4 ranks, Intimidate 4 ranks, Knowledge (Religion) 4 ranks

### False Idol

A Black Bishop chooses one of the following groups to forge a pact with:
* Demons (CE)
* Devils (LE)
* Daemons (TN)

The Black Bishop's alignment must be within one step of their chosen group. (e.g. A LN can align with a Daemon. A LE or a CE could not)

### False Domain

A Black Bishop gains the Charm, Trickery, Evil, or Law Domain. They gain the Domain powers for that domain but not the spells.

In return, they agree that once per Season they will sacrifice an opposed entity (Outsider, person, etc) to the Lords Below. If the fail to perform this sacrifice, they lose access to their domain.

 * Demons: Sacrifice any Good or Lawful creature.
 * Devils: Sacrifice any Good or Chaotic creature.
 * Daemons: Sacrifice any Evil creature.

Spellcasters of Neutral alignment that have sacrificed any non-evil creature at any time automatically have their alignment shift to Evil.

### False Miracles

Black Bishops add their Class Level to any Use Magic Device check to cast a Divine Spell from anything that looks 'Holy' (e.g. Wand shaped as a holy symbol, rings with a holy symbol engraved). In addition, whenever a Black Bishop uses False Casting he gets a +10 profane bonus to any opposed Bluff check when casting the spell.

In return, they increase their sacrifices to twice per Season.

### Master of Lies

 At 3rd level, a Black Bishop adds his class level to any Bluff check made as part of a lie or deception. In addition, whenever he is subject to a spell or special ability that can discern whether or not he is telling the truth, he is automatically aware of such magic. He is not immune to such spells or abilities, but he can choose to remain silent or avoid answering questions.

In return, they increase their sacrifices to a monthly basis.

### Bishop's Authortiy

 At 4th level, a Black Bishop can use Intimidate as a move action.

### Tainted Miracles

 At 4th level, a Black Bishop can sacrifice divine magic users of any religion other than their own (e.g. Paladins, Antipaladins, Druids, Oracles, Clerics) to augment their magical powers. Every time they ritually sacrifice such a being to the Lords Below, they gain access to any spell on the divine spellcaster's list as a reward. This access allows them to add the spell to their spell list and inscribe it into their spellbook as if they are copying it from another person's spellbook, if required by their arcane spellcasting class.

In addition, all spells they cast gain the Evil descriptor as they are now directly channeling magic harvested from the souls of their victims.
